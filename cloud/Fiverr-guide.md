```
Hey, I'm [Your Name].
I write blog posts that people actually want to read — not the boring, keyword-stuffed kind that puts everyone to sleep.
I got into writing a few years back when I started my own blog. What began as a hobby turned into something I genuinely love doing. Now I help businesses and creators get their message across in a way that feels natural and engaging.
My focus: SEO blog posts, website content, and articles across different niches.
I'm pretty easy to work with. Send me your topic, and I'll handle the rest.
```

#### **OPTION B: Product Description Bio**
```
Hi there! I'm [Your Name].
I write product descriptions for online stores — the kind that actually make people want to buy.
Started doing this when I helped a friend with their Etsy shop. Turns out I was pretty good at it. Now I've written descriptions for everything from handmade jewelry to tech gadgets.
What I do: Amazon listings, Shopify descriptions, Etsy products, and general e-commerce copy.
If your products are great but your descriptions aren't doing them justice, let's fix that.
```

#### **OPTION C: YouTube Script Bio**
```
Hey! I'm [Your Name].
I write scripts for YouTube videos — the kind that hook viewers in the first 5 seconds and keep them watching until the end.
Been doing this for a while now, working with creators across tech, gaming, lifestyle, and educational content. I know what works on YouTube because I've spent way too many hours watching it myself.
What I offer: Full video scripts, hooks, outlines, and storytelling structure.
Ready to make your next video your best one? Let's talk.

### **Step 5: Gig Description**
#### **BLOG WRITING GIG DESCRIPTION:**
```
Let's be real — most blog posts are forgettable.
They're either stuffed with keywords that make no sense, or so generic you forget them the moment you finish reading. I write the other kind.
I've been creating content for blogs and websites for a while now. What started as writing for my own projects turned into helping others get their message across. These days, I focus on posts that are actually useful — the kind readers bookmark and share.

HERE'S WHAT YOU GET:
→ Well-researched content (not just surface-level fluff)
→ SEO basics covered — keywords placed naturally
→ Clear structure with headings that make sense
→ Writing that sounds like a human, not a robot
→ Revisions until you're completely happy

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
→ Your topic or title idea
→ Target audience (who's reading this?)
→ Any keywords you want included
→ Word count needed
→ Tone preference (casual, professional, etc.)

I've written about tech, health, business, lifestyle, travel, finance — pretty much anything that doesn't require a medical degree.

Quick note: I don't do academic papers or super technical documentation. But for blogs and articles? I've got you.

Questions? Just message me. I actually read and reply to everything.
```

#### **PRODUCT DESCRIPTION GIG DESCRIPTION:**
```
Your product deserves better than a boring description.
You know what I'm talking about — those generic, copy-paste listings that could describe literally anything. That's not what sells. What sells is copy that makes people actually picture themselves using your product.

That's what I do.
I write product descriptions for online stores, Amazon sellers, Etsy shops, and anyone trying to sell something on the internet. The goal is simple: make your product sound as good as it actually is.

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
→ Descriptions that highlight benefits, not just features
→ Natural keyword integration for search visibility
→ Easy-to-scan formatting
→ Tone matched to your brand
→ Revisions until it's right

I'VE WRITTEN FOR:
→ Fashion & accessories
→ Tech & gadgets
→ Home & kitchen products
→ Beauty & skincare
→ Handmade & craft items
→ Pet products
→ Pretty much anything you can sell online

WHAT I NEED:
→ Product info (name, features, specs)
→ Photos if you have them
→ Target customer (who's buying this?)
→ Any specific points to mention
→ Competitor examples (optional but helpful)

No fluff. No corporate jargon. Just clear, honest copy that helps your stuff sell.

Got questions? Drop me a message — I'm pretty quick to respond.
```

#### **YOUTUBE SCRIPT GIG DESCRIPTION:**
```
You've got 5 seconds to hook a viewer. Make them count.
I write YouTube scripts — the kind that grab attention immediately and keep people watching until the end. No "hey guys welcome back to my channel" openings. No rambling. Just content that flows naturally and keeps viewers engaged.

I've written for channels covering tech reviews, gaming, finance, lifestyle, true crime, motivation, and educational content. If it's on YouTube, I've probably written something similar.

WHAT YOU GET:
→ Strong opening hooks (the first 10 seconds matter most)
→ Conversational flow that sounds natural when spoken
→ Pacing that keeps things moving
→ Clear structure so there's no rambling
→ Timestamps and scene suggestions if needed

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
→ Topic or video idea
→ Target length (5 min, 10 min, etc.)
→ Your channel style and tone
→ Key points you want covered
→ Reference videos if you have them (helps me match your vibe)

Fair warning: My scripts are meant to be spoken, not read. They might look weird on paper, but they sound great on camera. That's kind of the point.

One more thing — I don't write scripts for content that spreads misinformation or harmful stuff. Everything else is fair game.
