Since that day, the sight or scent of his blood fills her with terror and sorrow, a memory she hides even from Liora. She remembers the warmth of his blood, her tears mixing with it on her lips, and his body resting lifelessly on her lap through the night. It was the moment she realized how much she loved him\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and how much she feared losing him again.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\n\r\n- robin New abilites: Temporal Reversal spell, once per week. rewind time for a single person, at most is 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n- robin had a secret memories of sexsual night with caelus, but caelus at that time is lossing control. only robin and liora know about this, and both women won't tell anyone(only liora and robin know about it), so robin is certified not virgin anymore.\r\n\r\n- from Arch 21 and on, robin is afraid sleep alone. she can't sleep alone, so there is always caelus and lingsha on her bed. robin personal bedroom is became hero party chamber (a chamber for robin, caelus, lingsha and liora).\r\n- robin was a possessive cat, since kronos incident robin always slept atop caelus chest. except she was beaten through rock, paper, scissors.\r\n- after chapter 544. robin could accesss at caelus divine form, by kiss caelus with prayer. and so for lingsha.\r\n\r\n## Lingsha ( Age: 20 )\r\n\r\nplace of Birth: lumora \r\n\r\nLingsha, the twenty-year-old priestess of the Hero Party, is both a healer and a beacon of warmth wherever she goes.

Beneath her bright demeanor, however, lies a depth of quiet longing. Like Robin, she harbors feelings for Caelus that she keeps hidden behind her easy laughter and gentle touch.

She descends and effortlessly hijacks control of the dream from Sunday. To undo Sunday's lies, Liora uses her power to share Robin and Lingsha's true memories of Caelus with the entire kingdom, revealing his heroic sacrifices and pure heart. The people awaken, their minds freed from the nightmare, and the dream world begins to dissolve. Robin offers her repentant brother forgiveness, choosing family despite his betrayal. Protected by Liora's magic, the group prepares to wake up in the real world, united and filled with hope for the future.

As the capital's citizens wake with their memories and the truth restored, they process their complicated feelings toward Caelus and Sunday. Robin calls for a public trial for her brother, not for revenge, but for public accountability and justice. Caelus, showing unexpected mercy, proposes that Sunday be stripped of power and instead serve the kingdom through labor and redemption. The crowd accepts this judgment, choosing tempered justice over vengeance. the nightmare truly over.\r\n\r\nAfter they got time to breath. Liora visits Caelus at night, but a sudden nosebleed reveals she is still suffering from the effects of Solareth's curse, which she took upon herself to protect him. In a heartfelt moment, he apologizes for his past mistrust and thanks her for her endless sacrifices. They share childhood memories, strengthening their bond. she wants Caelus to attend her Strategic Studies class at the academy as a student.\r\n\r\nLiora, in her Professor Elira persona, arranges for Caelus to attend the academy as a student, seeing it as a precious gift of normalcy before the coming war.\r\n\r\nOn their final day before announcing the war publictly, Robin and Liora switch roles: Robin teaches at the academy while Liora handles corrupt politicians.\r\n\r\nLiora confesses to Caelus that the coming demon army will be led by Demon King Valthor himself, a threat that could overwhelm all their preparations. She reveals her deep, familial love for him and asks for permission to openly spoil and pamper him as her little brother. Fearing she may not survive confronting Valthor, she wants to create more cherished memories. Caelus, overwhelmed with emotion, gives his permission and makes her promise to return, vowing to publicly declare his love for her as his sister when she does.\r\n\r\n## Arc 14\r\n\r\nThe King and Robin publicly announce that Demon King Valthor's army is days away from attacking the capital. A secretly summoned allied army arrives as Robin reveals their extensive, hidden preparations for war. Throughout the announcement, Liora (as Elira) openly shows affection for Caelus, stroking his hair and holding his shoulder, which he accepts without protest due to their promise. The initial panic of the crowd transforms into determined resolve to fight together. The chapter ends with the kingdom united and preparing for the imminent battle.\r\n\r\nAfter evacuating civilians, the capital prepares for its final stand. The Headless Dragon, its restrictions weakened by Sunday's earlier tampering, appears and tears open a gateway between worlds in the sky. As the demon army begins to pour through the rift.\r\n\r\nThe demon army arrives, led by three terrifying Demon Lords( Lord of death, thanatos. Lord of Flies, beelzebub. and lord of sky, aquila ) and the colossal Demon King Valthor, whose presence alone causes soldiers to collapse. and valthor vansihed from battlefield to catch liora.\r\n\r\n## Arc 15 (character didn't include: liora)\r\n\r\nIn the war. robin role as main commander and strategies.

The feat comes at a great cost, as the sword's curse renders him comatose and near death. Lingsha catches his falling body and saves him by transferring her own life force through a desperate, healing kiss. while liora fight alone against demon king in other dimension.\r\n\r\nWith the demon lords defeated, the remaining horde is vanquished and the headless dragon is subdued.

In a public, many soldiers is seeing, and intimate moment, both women kiss him, a clear declaration of their love witnessed by the entire kingdom.\r\n\r\n## Arc 16 (character didn't include: liora)\r\n\r\nWhile Caelus was unconscious, Robin and Lingsha continued to care for him without shame or hesitation. Liora had not returned since she challenged the Demon King alone.\r\n\r\nSunday, though hated by the residents of Sunstone, was needed in the current state of the kingdom.\r\nSunday returned to her former position and promised not to repeat it.\r\n\r\nAfter Caelus regained consciousness, Astraea invited the hero party to visit the mass grave where tens of thousands of soldiers had died in the process.\r\n\r\nIn front of the soldiers' graves, Caelus tried to stand alone, though his body was still covered in wounds and he struggled to stand. Caelus prayed and apologized for failing to protect them all. Caelus's heart, already wounded by Liora's lack of news, was now even more shattered by his failure to protect the people.\r\n\r\nAs Caelus's heart grew more shattered, Spirit Wings, a loyal follower of the goddess Solara, held Caelus alone like a cocoon. This hug was very warm, like Solara herself giving warmth to Caelus, and also hiding Caelus's cries like a child in front of the people there.\r\n\r\n## Arc 17\r\n\r\nJust as Caelus was recovering, the king ordered him to immediately finish off Aquila, who was bound by magic. Aquila began to struggle, and before she could lose control, Caelus had to finish her off.\r\n\r\nWith a single draw of Solareth, Caelus successfully finished off Aquila, leaving her exhausted and in the arms of Robin and Lingsha.\r\n\r\n## Arc 18\r\n\r\nHero party discus about liora in hell against valthor.

The hero party's plan is to tell the king about their next journey, a journey no human has ever attempted: entering hell.\r\n\r\nThe hero party's journey is to save Liora from Valthor. However, the hero party disguises their purpose by saying it is to understand the structure of hell and find out the whereabouts of Valthor, who suddenly disappeared during the last great war.\r\n\r\nKing and queen didn't doubt caelus and robin, they give full support for hero and their journey. the king and queen just hope that the hero party didn't throw away their live easily, hope for all of them to return.\r\n\r\nAstraea who is trusted friend of hero party join the journey. other than hero party, only astraea who know liora identity.\r\n\r\n## Arc 21  (Ch. 98 - 107)\r\n\r\none day before going to hell. robin sleep alone on her room, it' unusual for her.\r\n\r\nRobin wakes from Kronos's vision, traumatized by seeing Caelus die fifty different ways.

Kronos speaks privately to Robin: he'll summon two god-tier entities (Giant Dullahan and Bahamut) to prove Caelus will die. But it's a \"playground\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddeath is temporary, he'll resurrect them. He wants to see if Robin can change fate. Landscape transforms to vast, empty plain.

Remembers Liora saying Solara responds to strong will (like Caelus in cemetery). Robin steps forward despite wounds and lightning, demanding Solara's help\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot prayer but declaration. She refuses to accept fate. A divine presence acknowledges her: \"Show me your strength, child.\"\r\n\r\nRobin runs toward dying Caelus, wounded by demons and lightning. Her mind suddenly accelerates\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSolara's blessing giving her 1000% mental capacity. She understands Liora's magic, Fourth Layer mechanics, everything. Creates unprecedented spell: Temporal Reversal (Personal Scale)\u00e2\u20ac\u201drewinding Caelus to pre-combat state. Price: her own life force and existence as fuel.

They proceed to Fifth Layer portal.\r\n\r\n## Arc 22 (Ch. 108 - 109)\r\n\r\nFlashback to capital war: Liora confronts Valthor directly alone. She understood: he's exhausted, not evil. Valthor's Truth:\r\n\r\nWar is theater to unite demons (else they'd destroy themselves) Killing old demon lords using Caelus as grindstone Plans to seal Earth/Hell with Kronos once old powers die Never intended to kill Liora (respects her).\r\n\r\nLiora's Trap: Before Valthor can return to battle, Liora activates Ultimate Mind Prison: Shared Torment. Transfers Solareth's curse (divine, so Valthor can't resist) into shared loop. Both experience million deaths from mortal perspective. liora dies hourly. The Philosopher's Stone:\r\n\r\nLiora compressed her soul for immortality Resurrects her each death Price: no reincarnation when depleted Her entire lineage vanishes when stone shatters She'll never see Caelus's children\r\n\r\nValthor broken by understanding mortal deaths, frozen in the place. Liora ensures he can't threaten Caelus. Both trapped waiting for rescue.\r\n\r\nLiora's perspective: Dying repeatedly, losing sanity. Holds onto memory for warmth: 17 years ago, liora fleeing assassination, hiding in Clearwater Village as child. six-year-old Caelus shares three terrible, burnt rice balls: \"You need them more.\" Shows her his village, ridiculous sword skills, accidentally hits her head with wooden sword. Gives her carved wooden bird: \"So you remember you have a friend.\" That moment defined her existence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfirst time feeling attachment. He became her treasure, her reason for existing. Present: Realizes she won't see his future children. Philosopher's Stone is finite\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe'll vanish completely when depleted. But it's worth it. Calls across dimensions for him to come soon, before stone shatters.\r\n\r\n## Arc 23 ( ch. 110 - 118 )\r\n\r\nHero party ( robin, caelus, lingsha, and astraea ) arrive at the layer 5. run with all their might from demon army into valthor's castle.\r\n\r\nThrone room: Valthor collapsed on floor, broken. Liora suspended in chains, blood everywhere, Philosopher's Stone visible in chest. Both trapped in death/resurrection cycle. Caelus can't stop it\u00e2\u20ac\u201duntil he acts on instinct: forehead kiss (what Liora always did for him). Simple love breaks impossible spell instantly. Valthor's Release: Exhausted, transformed by experiencing million mortal deaths. Orders them to leave\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpayment for freeing him. Won't fight today but promises future battle when recovered.\r\n\r\nPortal to Fourth Layer. Robin calls Kronos for sanctuary. Time Lord provides chamber with normal flow, reveals weeks passed outside.\r\n\r\ncaelus declares he loves his big sister Elira, loves being pampered by her, will tell everyone publicly. Robin and Lingsha add: \"You're our big sister too.\" Liora finally accepts she's not alone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcan be protected, not just protector. Family takes turns caring for each other. She reveals Philosopher's Stone's cost: finite resurrections, no reincarnation, effectively mortal now.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for Liora to recover in Kronos's sanctuary, the Hero Party reflects on their journey through Hell. Robin admits (with embarrassment) that she created her new Temporal Reversal magic in desperation to save Caelus, nearly killing herself in the process.\r\n\r\nLiora pretends to sleep but secretly listens, deeply moved by Robin's confession that she created impossible magic purely out of love for Caelus.\r\n\r\nLiora wakes recovered but weakened. Before returning to Earth, she wants to thank the succubi who helped protect the Hero Party during their descent. Caelus insists on carrying Liora despite her protests, refusing to let her walk until they reach Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u201da reversal of their usual dynamic. Robin, Lingsha, and Astraea mercilessly tease Liora about being carried \"like a princess,\" turning the tables on her usual teasing of Caelus.\r\n\r\nReaching the First Layer with Earth's portal visible, Caelus's stomach growls loudly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe hasn't eaten properly in days. He decides to cook a \"Hell lunch\" using ingredients from the dangerous Verdant Hunger layer, insisting on gathering them while still carrying Liora. Using his spirit wings, Caelus flies through the carnivorous jungle collecting ingredients under Liora's guidance: Nightshade Blooms, Hellfruit Caps, Emberfruit, and silver leaves. Despite dodging deadly plants, he refuses to put Liora down. He successfully prepares a meal from Hell's ingredients, creating something delicious and safe. The party shares this meal before stepping through the portal home, Caelus keeping his promise to carry Liora until they truly reach Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Hero Party emerges from the portal to find hundreds of people waiting\u00e2\u20ac\u201da massive celebration organized by Sunday and Astraea's knights. Despite returning from Hell with visible wounds, the party looks happy and refreshed, leading soldiers to joke about whether they visited Hell or a beach. Sunday has prepared a feast, working his redemption through service. The King and Queen embrace Robin with relief. People notice Caelus still carrying \"Professor Elira,\" but the mood is too joyful for gossip.\r\n\r\nThat night, Robin insists everyone sleep in her room since her bed is largest. Liora admits she doesn't want to sleep alone after being isolated during Valthor's torture\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe wants to stay with family. Caelus is placed in the middle with Robin, Lingsha, and Liora surrounding him. When he asks why they want to sleep beside him (concerned he smells bad compared to their pleasant fragrances), he falls asleep mid-question. The three women share quiet confessions about loving him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin remembering his bloodied kiss that saved his life, Lingsha speaking of his protective nature, and Liora reflecting on seventeen years of watching over him.\r\n\r\nSummary: from Arc 14 until arc 23. liora absence from hero party, because fighting against valthor directly, in hell alone until caelus save liora from valthor.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc 24 ( Ch. 119 - 121 ) | (Character active: robin, caelus, lingsha, liora, sunday, king, and queen  )\r\n\r\nat the morning, Caelus wakes early, carefully extracts himself from the sleeping women, and prepare for cooking. At breakfast with the King, Queen, and Sunday, Liora eats the rice balls and breaks down crying\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey taste exactly like the three burnt rice balls six-year-old Caelus shared with her when she was hiding as a child.\r\n\r\nAt noon, Caelus stands with Liora on the platform and declares loudly to the gathered crowd how much he loves his Big Sister, explaining that family is chosen through love and sacrifice, not just blood.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, Caelus's spirit wings activate without his knowledge, spreading impossibly wide to embrace the entire city. Thousands of golden feathers fall, and every person receives one. Through the feathers, Solara's voice speaks directly to their souls, blessing the entire capital with healing from war trauma. She uses the metaphor of \"rice balls\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsimple love being more powerful than grand gestures.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Arc The Phoenix and the Price of Forever (Ch. 122 - 137)**\r\n\r\nThe peace earned by Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing was a fragile thing, soon tested by duty. The call came to slay a phoenix, a creature of legend that had scorched a land and claimed lives for two long years. With Sunday joining to honor the fallen, Caelus and his family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u201dset out on a mission they knew could be their last.\r\n\r\nTheir journey was a tapestry of light and shadow, showcasing Caelus's gentle power as he disarmed foes with apologies and inspired bandits to reform with gifts of golden hope. Yet, it was the quiet, playful moments\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike Robin and Lingsha demanding to be fed with the same childish affection he showed captives\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat truly bound them, solidifying a family forged in shared, absurd joy.\r\n\r\nThe confrontation at the Far East Castle was a descent into hellfire. The phoenix, Ember-Wing, was a brilliant, regenerating force of nature against which Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holy sword was less effective. The battle raged, leaving Caelus severely burned. In a desperate gambit, Robin orchestrated a complex fusion of blood and ice magic to expose the creature's core, allowing Caelus to strike a shattering blow that forced it to revert to an egg.\r\n\r\nBut from the ashes, hope exploded into despair. The egg detonated, and the reborn phoenix moved to finish a defenseless Caelus. In that heart-stopping moment, Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightmares became reality. Pushing her body and magic beyond all limits, she reached him, casting a forbidden Temporal Reversal. The cost was her own body, bleeding and breaking as she rewound time to restore him, paying the price in agony to buy him a second chance.\r\n\r\nRestored and enraged, Caelus took to the skies with Robin bleeding in his arms, his spirit wings a shield against the fire. He declared \"I've got you forever,\" a vow woven into the very air. When Robin stabilized enough to fight from his embrace, they moved as one\u00e2\u20ac\u201da single entity of divine speed and precise magic. Caelus drew his sword a second and final time, a act that fractured reality and his own mind. He cleaved the phoenix's egg in two, permanently ending the threat, but the curse of his power erupted within his skull, flooding him with a million deaths. His last conscious act was to ensure he and Robin landed safely before darkness claimed him.\r\n\r\nFor two days, he lay unconscious as the land began to heal. Robin kept vigil, her whispered confessions of terror, trust, and helpless love the only sound in the quiet tent. His awakening was perfectly Caelus: criticizing her poorly-measured soup with his first breath, sparking laughter and playful threats that filled the room with the truest taste of home.\r\n\r\nThe final truth, however, was bittersweet. With the arrival of Liora, they learned the phoenix was not a monster, but a mother, Ember-Wing, desperately protecting her nest. Their victory was also a tragedy. As Liora relocated the three remaining stone-like eggs to safety, the party was left to grapple with the complicated aftermath. They had saved countless lives and proven their love could bend time itself, but they now carried the weight of a truth where heroism and heartbreak were forever intertwined.\r\n\r\n## Arc Normal live ( Ch. 138 - 143  )\r\n\r\ncaelus talking with robin in the bed, while lingsha still sleeping. caelus talking the reason why robin use her temporal reversal magic to save caelus when fighting against phoenix. robin say, it's more hurt seeing caelus in pain than her own pain.\r\n\r\ntomorrow afternoon. Caelus insists on attending a council meeting with Robin and Sunday about governing the Far East territory cleared of the phoenix. after that Caelus becomes overwhelmed by the complex debates about governance. In the hallway, she and Sunday gently explain that support doesn't mean forcing himself to participate in battles he can't fight.\r\n\r\nat the evening. caelus goes to market to gather ingredients for \"healing hot pot.\" Along the way, he helps an elderly woman carry fabric for her daughter's wedding dress, comforts a crying boy with a broken toy (giving him a golden feather afterward), and is thanked by a mother whose wounded son was healed by Solara's blessing.\r\n\r\nafter that. He encounters Lingsha shopping for temple supplies and invites her to help gather ingredients. On their way back to the castle, Caelus and Lingsha encounter street musicians playing by the river at sunset. Lingsha asks Caelus to dance with her, and though he initially refuses (remembering his clumsy performance at Sunday's banquet), he sees the quiet longing in her eyes and changes his mind. Despite stepping on her feet multiple times, they dance together as citizens join in, inspired by the Hero and Priestess choosing joy over dignity. After dancing, Caelus adds a small amount of spice to the hot pot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot burning, just enough to make life feel \"alive\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinspired by the lesson that messiness and warmth make experiences real.\r\n\r\ntomorrow At the royal dining table, Caelus serves rice balls\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLiora's favorite from his village. He requests permission to visit Professor Elira's residence to check on her, admitting he misses his sister and worries she's not taking care of herself. The King and Queen remember the previous time these rice balls were served, when Elira broke down crying tears of joy. They grant permission immediately and reveal their jealousy about missing the legendary hot pot that made palace guards cry and the head chef reconsider his entire approach to cooking.\r\n\r\ntomorrow at the way to liora castle. Under the brilliant moon and stars, Caelus begins talking about the night after the Ocean's Edge battle when he carried Lingsha to watch moonlight atop Leviathan's corpse. With complete obliviousness, he recounts intimate details: how she fit perfectly in his arms, her hair smelling like herbs and flowers, her \"cute sleeping sounds,\" holding her hand until she fell asleep. He mentions her poetic phrase \"the moonlight is beautiful, isn't it?\" and his response agreeing about the literal moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc The Child Caelus (Ch. 144 - 160 )\r\n\r\nIn the enchanted silence of Liora's castle, a single, foolish act\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe cracking of a mysterious egg\u00e2\u20ac\u201dunleashed a wave of temporal magic that stripped the hero Caelus of his years and memories, leaving a terrified six-year-old in his place. The women who loved him, Robin and Lingsha, were suddenly cast into the roles of caretakers for a child who did not know them, their journey beginning with awkward meals and night terrors.\r\n\r\nDriven by a desperate hope, they took the boy to the ruins of his childhood home, Clearwater Village, where the utter desolation shattered his innocent world. He fell into a devastating grief, screaming for a mother and a home that were gone, and they held him through the storm, their embrace an unyielding anchor in his collapse. That night, he asked the only questions that mattered: \"Are you my family? Do you love me?\" Their passionate affirmations became the foundation upon which his broken spirit began to mend.\r\n\r\nDays filled with small joys and profound kindness followed. The city of Solphire embraced him, and even his sister Liora returned for a perfect, precious day of stories and magic, her heart breaking even as it swelled with love. On the final morning, the simple, silly chaos of a \"kiss attack\" cemented the feeling of a complete and joyful family.\r\n\r\nWhen the dawn of his return came, Caelus awoke with the dual weight of a man's life and a child's experiences, flooding him with mortification. But the women reassured him with a truth that erased all shame: he had never been a burden, but a gift. To express the inexpressible, he cooked a meal that carried his entire heart, a silent testament to a debt that was not a debt, but a gift of love freely given. They had held him when he fell, and in doing so, proved that even when a home is lost, a family remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Arc VI: The Calm Before the Storm (Ch. 161 - 175)**\r\n\r\nThe warmth of family life, with playful nights in Liora's castle and tender \"not-dates\" in the city, was a precious but fleeting peace. It was shattered by a dire warning from the depths of Hell itself. Liora revealed the devastating consequence of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own heroism: by wielding Solareth to slay five demon lords, he had forced the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand. The 3,000-year war would now end in a final, total demon conquest within one to two years.\r\n\r\nA grim resolve settled over the kingdom. The royal family, now fully united, gave their blessing not just for war, but for Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart, freeing\r\n\r\n# Arc The Burden of Dawn ( 176 - 188)\r\n\r\nIn the quiet dawn following days of rest, Caelus wakes surrounded by those who love him, yet a shadow looms over their peace. A journey to the Legendary Forest reveals a devastating truth carved in ancient stone: the holy blade Solareth is a death sentence for its wielder, bound to Caelus until his last breath. The demons, aware of this fatal flaw, now wage a war of attrition, forcing him to draw the blade and hasten his own end.\r\n\r\nReturning home burdened with this secret, his companions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dweave a web of protection around him. They discover his spirit wings continuously shed golden feathers, each one a blessing that carries not just divine comfort, but the unique, personal essence of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own love. Yet even this miracle is tempered by strategy and sorrow, as a war council confirms their fears: a massive assault is coming to Ocean's Edge Fortress, designed to force Caelus to his doom.\r\n\r\nAmidst frantic military preparations and desperate personal sacrifices, a fragile hope blossoms. Under a full moon, robin ask caelus for a date, liora and lingsha help prepare robin and caelus clothes, and caelus take robin atop castle at the night, dance and watching a beautifull moon, Robin confesses her love in a tender kiss, a quiet promise of a future they may never have. Caelus, beautifully oblivious yet instinctively kind, accepts her heart even as he fails to grasp its full meaning. They stand on the precipice of battle, a hero shielded by secrets and a love strong enough to bend time itself, all racing to prepare for a confrontation that will determine if they can save their world without destroying their hero in the process.\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Ocean's Edge Gambit ( Ch. 189 - 205 )\r\n\r\nThe morning after their rooftop date, Caelus is flustered by a coordinated \"ambush\" of affection from Robin, Lingsha, and Liora. After a final, warm breakfast with the royal family, who reflect on Robin's joyful transformation, the convoy departs for the war at Ocean's Edge. The journey is immediately imperiled by the god-dragon Bahamut, but Robin's brilliant strategy of concealment, using Liora's illusions and Lingsha's arrays, saves them from certain destruction.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival, the weight of their positions settles in. Liora explains her political neutrality prevents her from directly fighting, and Robin is forced to make heartbreaking calculations, ordering Caelus not to use his divine sword, Solareth, even as they watch soldiers die. The battle begins at dawn against three demon lords and their horde. Caelus and his Elite Squad Seven are locked in a desperate dance with the death knight, the Giant Dullahan, suffering heavy losses while trusting Robin's command.\r\n\r\nAs the demon lords unleash their ultimate magics, Robin is forced to play her hand. Caelus draws Solareth, with Astraea bearing the curse, to slay the Nightmare Lord. But the Dullahan responds by unleashing a crippling death aura. To save the entire army, Caelus draws Solareth a second time, absorbing a catastrophic curse to kill the Dullahan before falling unconscious from the strain.\r\n\r\nWith one demon lord remaining and their forces exhausted, Robin faces an impossible choice: let Caelus wake to a potential massacre or risk her own life to save him. Defying all strategic logic, she chooses love. Using her forbidden Temporal Reversal magic, she heals Caelus but collapses from the backlash. Awakened and restored, Caelus understands her sacrifice. He confronts and destroys the final demon lord, but this time, he honors Robin's love by choosing to survive, letting the army handle the cleanup. Victorious but weary, they reunite, hand-in-hand, their bond forged in the terrible fires of command and sacrifice, finally allowing themselves to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc The Burden and Blessing of Survival (Ch. 206 - 207 )\r\n\r\nThe arc begins with the somber Pilgrimage to the Graves, as Caelus, accompanied by Robin, Lingsha, and Liora, visits the mass grave of the eight hundred fallen soldiers. Standing before the grieving families and surviving soldiers , Caelus expresses The Hero's Apology and Prayer, apologizing for his inability to save everyone but immediately honoring their courage and sacrifice. He then offers a public prayer to Solara, imploring her to honor and love the souls of the dead. This prayer is met with Divine Acknowledgement as Caelus's spirit wings manifest and release exactly eight hundred golden feathers, one for each grave , providing immense comfort to the mourners by individually acknowledging the value of every sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe arc shifts immediately to The Release of Grief and Gratitude upon their return to the tent. Overwhelmed by the loss of so many and the profound relief that his own family survived, an emotionally exhausted Caelus breaks down in tears. His three companions immediately offer a silent, supportive embrace, understanding the weight of his survivor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guilt. The intimate moment is broken by Sunday, who enters with reports but quickly assesses the scene and joins the embrace. The chapter concludes with the five of them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus, Robin, Lingsha, Liora, and Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstanding together as a safe, united family, solidifying the bonds of love that remain after the horrific battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc VII: The Burden of Divinity (208 - 227 )\r\n\r\nThe victory over demon lords came with an unexpected price. No longer just a hero, Caelus had become a divine symbol, and the world descended upon him not with gratitude, but with demands. Exploitative marriage proposals and political offers flooded the crown, forcing his family to erect a protective wall around his gentle spirit. The threat escalated when the Kingdom of Valcrest delivered an ultimatum: Caelus must attend their festival, or they would shatter the human alliance on the eve of the demon war.\r\n\r\nForced into a political viper's nest, Caelus agreed without hesitation, his selflessness a sharp blade that cut his loved ones with guilt. They surrounded him with an unbreakable guard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, Sunday, and Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortress of loyalty in a court of cold calculation. In Valcrest, they faced not only the arrogant Prince Aldric but a more insidious enemy: the dehumanizing view of Caelus as a \"strategic asset\" with a \"limited operational lifespan.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle was fought not with swords, but with words. Sunday, seeing his own past arrogance in the prince, engaged in a diplomatic duel. Robin and Lingsha became impenetrable shields, deflecting every noble's attempt to weaponize Caelus's compassion. The climax came not in a throne room confrontation, but in a moment of profound humility. When King Mordain apologized for treating him as a resource, Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat it was an improvement over a lifetime of being called \"worthless\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshattered the king's worldview. Mordain saw the truth: Solara had chosen Caelus not for his power, but for a heart that remained kind despite a world of cruelty.\r\n\r\nThis revelation culminated in a speech to seven thousand soldiers. Caelus, speaking from his own scars, told them they were not acceptable losses, but individuals who mattered. As he declared them all \"children of Solara,\" his spirit wings released a shower of golden feathers, a divine blessing that settled on every single soul, uniting an army in shared humanity.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the greatest victory was not a political concession, but a gift of freedom. A humbled King Mordain granted Caelus a single day of pure, responsibility-free joy. For one perfect day, the hero was simply a young man, dragged through bakeries and playgrounds by the women he loved, teasing and being teased, his laughter a more powerful magic than any blessing. As they returned home, lighter in spirit and strengthened in resolve, they carried a renewed purpose: to fight for a world where Caelus could be not a god, not a weapon, but a human, cherished and free.\r\n\r\n## Arc The Simple Joy of Closeness and Comfort (Ch, 228 - 232)\r\n\r\nThe arc begins with the **Triumphant and Energetic Homecoming** of the Sunstone delegation from Valcrest, where only Caelus is bursting with energy while the others are exhausted. His first priority is planning a seven-day date with Liora, which he eagerly shares with Professor Elira upon their arrival at Solphire's gate. This period, granted by Elira, is defined by simple yet profound acts of affection, including **Shared Rest and Promise**: sleeping with Liora using him as a pillow, cooking meals together (including a personal promise of longevity noodles for just the two of them), and lighthearted, intimate activities like princess-carrying Liora while teasing a wyvern, catching fish by storytelling, and peacefully watching the sunset together.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe focus then shifts to the persistent, **Comical Closeness** his found family now demands. Back in Solphire, Caelus ponders the \"Caelus Pillow Effect\" as he questions Sunday about why Liora and Robin consistently use him as a pillow, revealing his sweet, oblivious nature. This need for proximity escalates with the girls' **Smothering Protocol**\u00e2\u20ac\u201da payback for his seven-day absence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich manifests as increased, affectionate teasing. The arc concludes by showcasing the hero's unique, non-combat contribution to the world, successfully completing a mission that required not magic or weapons but his **Specialized Comfort** through cooking. Exhausted but content after using his skill to help others, the Hero Party finds simple, collective peace by sleeping together on the grass beneath the stars. The arc is a celebration of the hero's return, focusing on the intimate, often humorous, domestic moments and shared rest that form the deep, loving foundation of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n# The Lumora Arc: Narrative Summary (Ch.233 - 267)\r\n\r\n## Part One: Corruption Revealed\r\n\r\nThe Hero Party's return to Lumora should have been triumphant. Instead, Caelus discovered something worse than any demon lord\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsystematic corruption festering in the Temple of Solara itself.\r\n\r\nHigh Priest Valorin had transformed a sacred institution into a marketplace. Divine blessings weren't freely given anymore; they were sold. Citizens with money received priority access to healing and prayers. Common people waited weeks for appointments that would never come. The young priestess Celestine, appointed as temporary High Priestess during Lingsha's absence, had been manipulated into becoming Valorin's unwitting accomplice, signing off on donation schemes and priority access arrangements she'd been led to believe were normal temple practice.\r\n\r\nWhen Lingsha began investigating, she discovered the depth of the rot: corrupt nobles bankrolling the system, senior priests enriching themselves, junior priestesses enduring harassment in silence. The financial records were meticulous\u00e2\u20ac\u201dValorin had documented everything, probably to maintain leverage over his noble allies.\r\n\r\nThe initial strategy seemed sound: gather evidence, present it to the temple council, let formal procedure handle the corruption. Lingsha, Celestine, and their supporters began an audit of temple finances. They had documentation. They had witnesses. They had facts.\r\n\r\nThen Valorin moved.\r\n\r\n## Part Two: The Counterattack\r\n\r\nHe struck with surgical precision. In a single morning council session, Valorin flipped the narrative completely. Using his noble allies' coordinated testimony\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall lying with perfect synchronization\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe transformed Celestine from victim into scapegoat. The financial records she'd signed became evidence of her eager participation. The corruption she'd been manipulated into endorsing became her willing crime.\r\n\r\nThe council voted to suspend her. Exile her to the royal estate pending investigation. They questioned whether Lingsha's judgment had been compromised by her personal attachment to a disgraced subordinate.\r\n\r\nOne morning. That's all it took for weeks of careful evidence gathering to become politically useless.\r\n\r\nCaelus had watched it unfold with growing horror. This wasn't combat. You couldn't stab corruption in council chambers. You couldn't fight lies with swords. The corrupt had turned the game itself into their weapon, using legitimate procedure to obscure illegitimate power.\r\n\r\nThat night, exhausted and frustrated, Caelus made a decision that seemed absurd but felt right.\r\n\r\n\"We should open a food stall,\" he announced.\r\n\r\n## Part Three: The Noodle Offensive\r\n\r\nEveryone stared at him.\r\n\r\n\"A food stall,\" Lingsha repeated slowly. \"Instead of continuing the investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not instead of,\" Caelus explained, his competitive nature activated by the challenge. \"Different battlefield. Valorin controls council chambers and has noble allies. He can manipulate procedure. But he can't control the streets. He can't stop people from eating. He can't attack someone for selling cheap noodles without revealing exactly what kind of person he is.\"\r\n\r\nRobin understood immediately\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe strategy shifting from formal channels to grassroots support. Lingsha caught on next. Even Liora, temporarily visiting from Hell, recognized the tactical brilliance.\r\n\r\nThey set up in the market with minimal equipment and maximum determination. Caelus cooked noodles. Lingsha prepared wontons. Robin managed crowds and payment. And something extraordinary happened.\r\n\r\nEvery person who ate the food reported the same experience: they tasted care. Not just technical skill or quality ingredients, but genuine love poured into every bowl. Customers would sit in silence, tears streaming down their faces, unable to articulate what they were experiencing beyond knowing that someone had made them food with complete devotion to their wellbeing.\r\n\r\nWord spread through Lumora like wildfire.\r\n\r\nThe Hero of Sunstone and the High Priestess were running a noodle stall. They were serving common people. They weren't in temples negotiating with nobles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey were in markets feeding whoever came, regardless of wealth or status.\r\n\r\nValorin couldn't attack this. Any move against them would prove his corruption. Try to shut down the stall? He's preventing divine service to common people. Criticize the princess and hero for serving cheap food? He's revealing his own contempt for common citizens. The more he opposed them, the more obvious his true nature became.\r\n\r\nThe line grew daily. Hundreds of people. Eventually over a thousand.\r\n\r\n## Part Four: The Personal Reckoning\r\n\r\nWhile this was unfolding, Robin was suffering alone in Solphire.\r\n\r\nShe'd been sleeping terribly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthree hours a night if she was lucky. Working eighteen-hour days on magical research, burying herself in documentation of temporal theory to avoid processing how much she missed them. Waking up reaching for people who weren't there. Nightmares about all the ways Caelus or Lingsha could die while they fought battles she wasn't part of.\r\n\r\nLiora found her like that\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbroken, exhausted, pretending everything was fine while slowly destroying herself through overwork and loneliness.\r\n\r\nThe demon lord did what family did: she retrieved her. She collected Robin from Solphire and brought her to Lumora, forcing a reunion that Robin desperately needed but thought she should deny herself.\r\n\r\nThe moment Robin arrived at the noodle stall and saw Caelus, she broke. He'd been so focused on fighting corruption that he'd forgotten to check on her. She'd been sleeping alone for weeks, terrified, working herself to exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\"You were supposed to visit,\" she said, tears streaming down her face.\r\n\r\nCaelus felt guilt crash over him like a wave. He'd been so caught up in the battle that he'd abandoned someone equally important. He'd learned a hard lesson about scattered family units: distance required active maintenance, not just assumption that people were fine.\r\n\r\nThat night, all four of them slept together\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus in the center with Robin on his chest, Lingsha on his right, Liora on his left. And in his sleep, when his exhausted brain confused cooking metaphors with reality, Caelus called Robin \"essential broth\" and cried at the thought of losing her.\r\n\r\nRobin, awake and listening, understood what he couldn't articulate while conscious: she was fundamental to him. Essential. The ingredient he couldn't cook without.\r\n\r\n## Part Five: The Temple Ceremony\r\n\r\nThe night before Robin had to return to Solphire, she took Caelus to the Temple of Solara's main sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u201dempty in the evening, sacred and beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"I want to practice a wedding ceremony,\" she said, her face turning red. \"For educational purposes.\"\r\n\r\nCaelus, completely oblivious to the actual implications, agreed.\r\n\r\nThey stood before the altar, joined hands, and made vows. Robin spoke first, her voice shaking but sincere, promising to stand beside him always. Caelus, not fully understanding what was happening but recognizing it mattered, promised to protect her, to be there when needed, to remember that she was essential to his life.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a real wedding. It was practice. Educational. Completely pretend.\r\n\r\nExcept to Robin, it was the most real thing she'd ever done.\r\n\r\n## Part Six: The Final Trial\r\n\r\nThe morning of the actual trial against Valorin, two things happened simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIn the public square, Caelus led ten thousand citizens in prayer. His spirit wings manifested and glowed golden as thousands of people experienced genuine divine connection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSolara herself answering through her champion. For the first time, they tasted what spiritual blessing actually felt like when uncorrupted by transaction. No payment. No priority access. Just divine love freely given to everyone who asked with honest hearts.\r\n\r\nThe experience was transformative. People cried. They understood viscerally what the temple had lost under Valorin's leadership.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the council chambers, Lingsha presented evidence with Robin and Liora as witnesses. The financial records were overwhelming. The testimony from junior priestesses about harassment was devastating. And Sunday, the reformed political operator, deployed ruthless strategy that destroyed every counterargument Valorin attempted.\r\n\r\nThe corrupt priest had nowhere to go. The public had experienced authentic spirituality\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey knew now what Valorin had stolen from them. The evidence was undeniable. The coordinated attack from multiple directions eliminated all escape routes.\r\n\r\nThe council voted unanimously. Valorin and his co-conspirators were expelled from the temple and remanded to secular authorities for criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe noble families who'd participated faced financial and social ruin.\r\n\r\nThe temple would be rebuilt under Lingsha's authority with one primary mission: genuine service to all people, regardless of wealth.\r\n\r\n## Epilogue: Bittersweet Farewells\r\n\r\nBut victory meant separation.\r\n\r\nRobin and Liora had duties waiting in Solphire. Caelus and Lingsha needed to remain in Lumora to oversee temple reconstruction. The Hero Party, brought together by crisis, had to scatter again.\r\n\r\nThe night before departure, all four of them slept together one final time. The morning came too early and too cold.\r\n\r\nRobin emerged from the bed reluctant and clingy, refusing to let morning arrive, acting like a child refusing to wake because reality meant losing family. She wrapped herself around Caelus on the walk to the portal, refusing to separate even for basic movement.\r\n\r\nWhen Liora opened the portal at dawn, they said their goodbyes. Embraces. Promises to write. Commitments to visit soon.\r\n\r\nThen Robin did something she hadn't done before. She kissed Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201don the lips this time, not the forehead blessing from yesterday. Quick and deliberate.\r\n\r\n\"Educational,\" she whispered. \"So you know what a real goodbye feels like.\"\r\n\r\nThen she stepped through the portal before he could respond, leaving Caelus standing in the courtyard, his hand touching his lips, finally understanding what all those vows and kisses had meant.\r\n\r\nRobin loved him. Romantically. Completely. And he'd been too oblivious to recognize it.\r\n\r\nafter that Caelus and Lingsha returned to Lumora's chambers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlarger and emptier now, the weight of separation settling over them like snow.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Lumora Interlude Ch. 268 - 272 (Character include: Caelus, Lingsha, and Celestine)\r\n\r\nIn the peaceful aftermath of Lumora's liberation ( caelus, lingsha, and celestine doing street blessing at the street ), Lingsha and Caelus find themselves alone, shouldering the burden of rebuilding the temple and the city's faith. Their relationship deepens during twilight conversations where Lingsha confesses her romantic love, and Caelus, though confused by romance, expresses that she is \"essential\" to him.\r\n\r\nThey establish a quiet sanctuary in nightly visits to a secluded onsen, where they talk and redefine dating on their own terms: a space for honesty and comfort. By day, they perform public street blessings, healing the city side-by-side.\r\n\r\nTheir new bond is tested when temple duties force Lingsha to miss their meeting, and Caelus waits for hours in the cold, falling ill. In response, Lingsha shuts out the entire world for a \"Day of Atonement,\" dedicating herself wholly to his care. Through this, they solidify their understanding: they are essential to each other, navigating love not with grand romance, but with patience, presence, and a language of care that is uniquely their own.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Final Sacrifice of Lumora Ch. 273 - 275 (Charater include: Caelus, Lingsha, and celestine )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Premonition**\r\nIn the dead of a perfectly silent night, the Hero Caelus is jolted awake by a survival instinct honed by countless brushes with death. He feels a catastrophic presence approaching\u00e2\u20ac\u201done far beyond any demon lord he has ever faced. With his lover, the High Priestess Lingsha, he rouses the city of Lumora, evacuating civilians and marshaling its defenders. He sends a desperate plea for help to the demon lord Liora, but knows it will arrive too late. The air grows heavy with a terrifying, inevitable pressure, the calm before an unimaginable storm.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Arrival of Inevitability**\r\nThe sky tears open not with violence, but with a surgeon's precision. Through it descends a single figure: Valthor, the Demon King. His mere presence is a weight that crushes hope and paralyzes three hundred defenders. He offers a chilling \"mercy\": the people may take their own lives quickly, or die in agony by his hand. His target is Caelus, and all who stand with him must share his fate. As despair breaks the defenders' will, driving some to suicide, Caelus makes a choice. He cannot win, but he can show them how to die fighting.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Bargain and the Burn**\r\nCaelus attacks, but the battle is a futile dance. Valthor, a being of five millennia of experience, deflects his divine-enhanced blows with one hand, offering clinical praise. When the Demon King finally strikes, he shatters Caelus's body. As Valthor begins to systematically raze Lumora, reducing districts to dust and fire, Caelus lies broken, watching his failure unfold. In a final, desperate act, he does not pray for strength, but for sacrifice. He offers his very soul to the goddess Solara as fuel, begging her to burn him for eternity if it means saving his loved ones and his city. Solara answers.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: A Moment of Grace Before the End**\r\nCaelus rises, transformed. His soul ignites into divine fire, manifesting as a brilliant halo and wings of pure radiance. He is no longer just a mortal hero, but a temporary divine instrument, burning from the inside out. He shares a heartbreaking farewell with Lingsha and Celestine, finally articulating the depth of his love before it is too late. He then turns to face Valthor, not for victory, but to buy time with his own existence.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: The Beautiful, Terrible Dance**\r\nThe sky becomes a canvas of light and darkness as the burning champion and the ancient king clash in earnest. Caelus fights with a speed and power fueled by his disintegrating soul, each strike an expression of his love for those below. Meanwhile, Lingsha and Celestine, shattering inside, force themselves to honor his sacrifice by moving through the ruined city, saving who they can as they watch the light of his life dim overhead.\r\n\r\n**Part 6: The Light Goes Out**\r\nThe battle accelerates into a frantic, final rhythm as Caelus's fuel runs critically low. In an instant, it is over. Valthor's hand appears inside Caelus's chest, and the Hero falls. His wings and halo extinguish, the last fragments of his soul scattering into nothingness. Lingsha races beneath him and catches his broken body, absorbing the impact. In his final moments, Caelus's thoughts are not of battle or glory, but of warm springs, laughter, and the simple peace he found with her. With a final whisper of love, his soul burns out completely.\r\n\r\n**Part 7: What Remains**\r\nIn the crushing silence, Lingsha cradles Caelus's lifeless body, her screams of grief echoing across the plaza. The city is saved, but at a cost that feels like defeat. The Hero who was their protector, the chef, the friend, and the lover is gone, having chosen to be consumed so that they might live. The arc closes on an image of profound loss and the devastating price of love\u00e2\u20ac\u201da world saved, but a heart left with only the searing memory of a beautiful, final burn.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Soul's Bargain Ch. 276 - 278\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Void of Sacrifice**\r\nThe arc opens in absolute darkness. Caelus awakens in a void, a transitional space between life and death, remembering he burned his soul to save his loved ones. Though physically whole, he is tormented by grief and loneliness, finally allowing himself to break down and mourn the life and people he left behind: Lingsha, Robin, and Liora. His despair is profound, but it summons a change in the void, which transforms into a beautiful, starlit garden.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: Divine Recognition and Reckoning**\r\nIn the garden, Caelus meets his patron goddess, Solara. For the first time, he is fully seen. Solara doesn't just thank him for his sacrifice; she apologizes for the immense burden she placed on him. She reveals she has witnessed every hidden moment of his suffering\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe agony of Solareth's curse, the private breakdowns, the constant performance of being \"fine.\" This divine recognition shatters the mental fortress Caelus built over a lifetime of trauma. He sobs in her arms ( Caelus using solara as pillow like childern when they cried), releasing years of accumulated pain, and in his broken state, he makes a desperate vow: if given another chance, he would not carry his burdens alone. He would be honest, let his loved ones in, and truly share their pains and his.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Devastation Left Behind**\r\nSolara shows Caelus a vision of the mortal world. He witnesses the devastating aftermath of his death: Lingsha cradling his body, shattered; Robin bloodied from a failed, desperate attempt to reverse time; and Liora, completely broken. Hearing their anguished cries, he speaks to them across the void, offering comfort. They respond with fierce, immediate offers to trade anything\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtheir power, their memories, their very existence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor his return.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Steep Price of a Miracle**\r\nSolara reveals there is a way, but the price is terrible. To resurrect Caelus, his burned soul must be replaced with fuel of equivalent value: half of Robin's soul and half of Lingsha's, offered willingly. This binding is permanent and will fundamentally change them. They will feel half of every physical and emotional pain Caelus endures, including the torment of Solareth's curse. They will carry a permanent void within them, an absence only eased by his proximity. It is a fate of shared suffering. Without hesitation, Robin and Lingsha agree. After a painful internal struggle, Caelus accepts their sacrifice, understanding it for what it is: the literal fulfillment of his promise to never be alone in his pain again.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: A Goddess's Farewell and a Hero's Return**\r\nIn a final, intimate farewell, Solara reveals the depth of her love for Caelus. She confesses she spent centuries building this loophole in divine law, defying the finality of death for his sake. This is the last chance; his next death will be permanent. She urges him to live fully, love deeply, and keep his promise. As the garden dissolves into pure white light, the ritual begins. The agony is excruciating as soul fragments are torn and bound. Caelus, Robin, and Lingsha scream in synchronized pain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe cost of a miracle. The arc concludes as the void releases him, and in the ruined plaza, Caelus's heart restarts, his eyes open, and he returns to life, forever bound to the two women who loved him enough to share his soul.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Resurrection and the Binding Ch. 279 - 282\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Return**\r\n\r\nCaelus awakens not to an afterlife, but to the overwhelming warmth of three women holding him: Liora, Robin, and Lingsha. He has returned from the dead, resurrected by a final, desperate miracle from his goddess, Solara. He learns the profound cost of his return: Solara has exhausted her last resurrection power for him, and his soul is now permanently bound to Robin and Lingsha, who each sacrificed a piece of their own essence to anchor him. This \"soul binding\" means they will forever share half of his physical and emotional pain. Though traumatized by his death, his family surrounds him with a fierce, protective love, vowing he will never carry his burdens alone again.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Aftermath**\r\n\r\nAs Caelus recovers, he confesses the truth of his death\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof meeting Solara in a secret dimension she built over a millennium just for him. Her love and grief healed his shattered soul, but her warning was clear: there are no more chances. Meanwhile, the strategic minds of the kingdom, led by Sunday, grasp the horrifying implications. The Demon King Valthor wasn't merely attacking; he was making a statement. By effortlessly killing their divinely-blessed Hero, he proved humanity's futility, a propaganda victory he will use to unite all of Hell for total war. The only path to survival is a desperate, immediate unification of all human kingdoms.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: A Celebration of Life**\r\n\r\nThe city of Lumora, saved by Caelus's sacrifice, throws a massive celebration. Initially uncomfortable with the praise, Caelus is guided to understand that the people need this\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot a somber speech, but a reminder of life's simple joys. He feeds them not with wisdom, but with his trademark terrible puns, filling the plaza with laughter and healing. He learns to accept their gratitude, recognizing that their shared feast is their way of loving him in return. As the day ends, Caelus is no longer just a survivor; he is a man bound to his loved ones, celebrated by his people, and determined to live a life worthy of the second chance he was given. The war for extinction looms, but for one afternoon, hope is rekindled through food, family, and terrible jokes.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Foundation of Hope ( Ch. 283 - 290 )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Weight of Truth**\r\nFollowing his miraculous return, Caelus is home in Solphire, surrounded by his family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, Liora, and the royal family. The relief of his homecoming is tempered by the looming threat of the demon king Valthor. In a private war council with the kings of Sunstone and Valcrest, Caelus makes a terrifying revelation: he can no longer be considered fully human. He demonstrates his divine form, a state powered by the burning of his original soul, and confesses that even with this power, he killed Valthor one hundred times in Lumora, only for the demon king to regenerate instantly each time. The chilling truth is laid bare: conventional power cannot win this war, and Caelus's ultimate weapon is a suicide pill that will eventually consume him completely.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: A New Doctrine for Survival**\r\nConfronted with the limits of their hero, the human kingdoms must adapt. Prince Sunday, the strategic mastermind, proposes a radical solution: stop relying on Caelus and make humanity strong enough to stand on its own. He unveils a complete military curriculum developed by Caelus and the knight-commander Astraea, proven by Elite Squad Seven\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoldiers trained to fight demon-level threats through perfect coordination and adaptive tactics. In a moving final training session, Caelus pushes the squad to their limits in his divine form, and to his immense pride, they successfully land a blow on him, proving that even divinity can be challenged with the right training.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Mission Begins** ( from here, only activate character: Elit squad seve, astraea, prince aldric, and his soldiers)\r\nElite Squad Seven, carrying the hopes of humanity, departs for the kingdom of Valcrest escorted by Prince Aldric. Their journey immediately turns from diplomatic to deadly when they discover the slaughtered village of Millbrook. They are ambushed by a flight of gargoyles, but the squad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s training proves devastatingly effective. They eliminate the threat without a single casualty, a stark demonstration of their capabilities for the Valcrest guards.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: Proving Grounds**\r\nIn Valcrest's capital, skepticism runs high. To secure the kingdom's full commitment, Elite Squad Seven must prove their worth in a public demonstration against Valcrest's most legendary warriors, the Crimson Vanguard. In a breathtaking display of coordination and tactical genius, the seven Sunstone soldiers systematically dismantle the eight veterans. The victory is so decisive it silences all opposition. King Mordain, witnessing this new hope for humanity's survival, immediately commits his entire kingdom to the military reformation, declaring that the methods born from Caelus's sacrifice will become the new foundation of their defense.\r\n\r\nThis arc, \"The Foundation of Hope,\" charts the pivotal shift from reliance on a single, self-sacrificing hero to the empowering belief that humanity, united and properly trained, can forge its own destiny against the coming darkness.\r\n\r\n## A Foundation for Survival and Love (Ch. 284 - 299)\r\n\r\nThe story arc begins with the Hero Party's Homecoming to Solphire, where they are warmly received, though King Seraphina and Queen Seraphina mourn the loss and resurrection of Caelus. Caelus demonstrates the Weight of Divinity with his new, overwhelming divine form, which prompts a strategic shift in humanity's war against Valthor: since the demon king can regenerate, the strategy becomes The Foundation of Survival\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstrengthening all of humanity through the Elite Squad Seven's methodology to make the war too costly for Hell. The Elite Squad Seven and Astraea prove the training's worth in The Final Lesson against Caelus's divine form and later in The Demonstration at Valcrest's colosseum, securing full military support to distribute the training.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, The Weight We Share focuses on Robin's futile attempts to recreate the time-reversal miracle, realizing that the miracle was not a matter of technical perfection but of absolute love and desperation. She and Liora conclude their research, a strategic move that Foundations and Rest reveals protects Robin from political pressure, though Robin privately promises Sunday she would repeat the choice to save Caelus despite the personal cost. This shift from technical to emotional foundations is mirrored in Golden Flight and Divine Pressure, where Caelus's visit to the Valcrest training grounds motivates the skeptical soldiers by allowing them to feel his overwhelming power firsthand, providing The Weight of Gold for their training goals. On the flight back in Questions in Flight, Caelus confesses his deepest fear of becoming useless, and Liora offers a fierce, unconditional affirmation of his worth.\r\n\r\nThe arc concludes with A Day Without Duty and the family's intentional vacation to connect and appreciate the world they protect, culminating in a hike up Mount Solara. The peaceful moment is broken in Beneath the Stars when Caelus discovers Liora meeting a succubus emissary from Hell; rather than confronting her, Caelus insists that as a family, they must now face such dangers together, establishing a new protocol of trust and mutual protection. The arc defines the new normal: humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survival is being built on strategic strength, while the hero's foundation is shifting from a reliance on individual power to the unconditional love and support of his found family.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Arc: The Gathering Storm (Ch. 300 - 312)\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Calm Before**\r\nIn the kingdom of Valcrest, the fruits of rigorous training are finally showing. Under the stern guidance of Commander Astraea and her Elite Squad Seven, five hundred soldiers are transforming from a hesitant militia into a coordinated, demon-fighting force. The city itself bears the marks of the Hero Caelus's recent visit, with his golden feathers serving as talismans of hope and comfort. The strategic coordinator, Sunday, arrives to assess the progress and is pleased with the results. He authorizes Astraea to share the terrifying, classified knowledge of Hell's five layers with the trusted Commander Gareth, a brutal lesson in what they are truly preparing to face. The mood is one of hard-won confidence and grim determination.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the capital of Sunstone, political machinations are underway. Sunday is tasked by King Mordain of Valcrest with a crucial, thankless role at the upcoming inter-kingdom summit: to be the political shield that protects the painfully accommodating Caelus from being exploited and consumed by every politician seeking to claim the Hero's divine favor for themselves. Sunday, a man still navigating his own path to redemption, accepts the burden, ready to be hated again if it means protecting his family.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Separation**\r\nThe strain of leadership and the unique nature of their bonds are tested when Caelus voluntarily travels to Hell with the demon lord Liora to attend her courtly meetings. Though the soul bond he shares with Princess Robin assures her of his safety, the physical distance is agonizing. Robin works herself to exhaustion, unable to rest while part of her soul is in another realm. The separation highlights their profound interdependence.\r\n\r\nCaelus, oblivious to the worry he causes, is in his element. He returns not with tales of horror, but with armloads of bizarre Hell-native ingredients and boundless enthusiasm for demonic cuisine. His joyful return and the extraordinary meal he prepares reunite the family and wash away the stress of his absence, a moment of pure, ordinary joy amidst their extraordinary lives.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Storm Breaks**\r\nThe fragile peace is shattered without warning. The Demon King Valthor, accompanied by the primordial dragon Bahamut, descends upon Valcrest. His arrival is an apocalypse of pure presence. The city is brought to its knees not by violence, but by overwhelming psychic pressure that shatters windows, minds, and any illusion of safety. He delivers a chilling declaration: the war will conclude **within** two years. The ambiguous timeline is a masterstroke of psychological warfare, designed to keep humanity in a state of perpetual, exhausting dread.\r\n\r\nThrough sheer will and training, Astraea and Elite Squad Seven remain conscious, coordinating evacuation and recovery while utterly helpless to challenge Valthor directly. Before departing, Valthor delivers a personal message: he remembers Caelus's death fondly and is intrigued to learn of his resurrection.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Aftermath and Response**\r\nSensing the wrongness across the continent, Caelus and Liora portal immediately to Valcrest, followed by Robin and Lingsha. They find a city in trauma, its spirit broken. The Hero Party splits to address the crisis: Caelus uses his gentle divine presence to provide a healing contrast to Valthor's terror, helping soldiers recover. Robin accelerates diplomatic efforts, moving the summit up and uniting kingdoms through shared fear. Lingsha tends to the countless civilians suffering from psychological wounds.\r\n\r\nThe trauma forges a hardened unity. Valcrest's political squabbles vanish, replaced by total commitment to mobilization. The training grounds swell with soldiers and civilians alike, all training with desperate intensity. In a final lesson before returning to Sunstone, Caelus grants their most promising new squad, Crimson Dawn, the \"honor\" of facing his full power\u00e2\u20ac\u201da demonstration that even in defeat, perfect coordination can create a chance for survival.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: The Space Between**\r\nExhausted, Robin and Lingsha return to Sunstone to prepare for the summit, their rest fitful and incomplete with Caelus still away. When he and Liora finally return late one night, they find the two women asleep on opposite sides of their large bed, unconsciously preserving the empty space between them for him. Caelus hesitates, fearing he will disturb their hard-won rest, but Liora guides him to understand that his presence is not an intrusion, but a completion. As he settles between them, their tension melts away, and through the soul bond, he finally understands the depth of their connection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat sometimes, simply being present is the most fundamental protection of all.\r\n\r\n## The Oblivious Shield of Innocence and summit session (Ch. 313 - 326)\r\n\r\nThe arc opens with a tender **Homecoming and Affection**, as Caelus's family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfind restorative sleep and emotional reconnection after his six-day absence, establishing their closeness through shared rest and his lovingly prepared \"milky curry.\" This bond is immediately followed by **Coordinated Affection and Awkwardness**, as the women playfully torment him with unbothered intimacy, leaving Caelus adorably flustered and providing a source of fond amusement for the observing royals who cherish his youth and innocence. This oblivious nature peaks during a diplomatic greeting when Caelus, standing between the high-status women who love him, passionately blesses a commoner's union by declaring that status is irrelevant to love, a moment of irony and genuine good faith that serves as a **Shield of Oblivion** for his protectors.\r\n\r\nThe core of the arc shifts to **The Price of Protection**, where the political summit turns toxic. As Sunday and the core group successfully gather intelligence on Hell's delayed invasion, the delegates panic and begin to irrationally **Scapegoat the Hero**, blaming Caelus for accelerating the crisis and even suggesting his surrender to Valthor. The core family, devastated by this betrayal, makes a solemn, unanimous decision to carry the **Beautiful Lie**, vowing that Caelus must never learn of the accusations to protect his mental well-being. This protective shield is reinforced through **Divine Intervention and Unconditional Love**: first, by young Celestine's tearful, furious testimony about Caelus's sacrifice, and finally, by Sunday and Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic use of Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s documented, profound love for him to cow the treacherous delegates into silence.\r\n\r\nThe arc resolves with the persistent **Comfort of the Oblivious**, as Caelus repeatedly returns from Hell\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere he is safer than on Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith cheerfully cooked meals, utterly unaware of the political trauma and the immense secret his family is bearing for him. His innocent, enthusiastic presence, even his hilarious accounts of driving Liora to distraction with cooking lessons, provides a powerful, cathartic balm of normalcy and love that cushions the heavy burden of their commitment. The family's final thoughts reaffirm their willingness to sacrifice their own peace of mind to preserve his, solidifying Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oblivious innocence as their most sacred and protected space.\r\n\r\nsince the summit start. caelus is rarely on earth, most of the time he spend it on hell with liora.\r\n\r\n### Arc: The Physics of the Heart ( Ch 327 - 328 )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Morning of Mortification**\r\nThe arc opens with Princess Robin waking to find herself in an impossibly compromising position: nose-to-nose with the still-sleeping Hero, Caelus. Before she can escape, a slight shift\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpropelled by the sleeping High Priestess Lingsha using Caelus as a pillow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dresults in their lips accidentally meeting. The scene erupts into chaos as Caelus awakens in a panic and the demon lord Liora, who witnessed the entire event, laughs uncontrollably. The morning breakfast becomes a \"Court of Public Breakfast,\" where the flustered couple's attempts at denial are mercilessly and joyfully exposed to the royal family, turning their private embarrassment into public, affectionate comedy.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Weight of Alliances and Vows**\r\nThe tone shifts to the political as the Sunstone delegation meets with King Mordain and Prince Aldric of Valcrest. They solidify the alliances forged at the recent summit, establishing a unified front against the coming invasion from Hell. The meeting then turns deeply personal: Aldric and his commoner fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, Elara, reveal they are holding two wedding ceremonies. They extend a heartfelt invitation to Caelus, not as a political symbol, but as family, moved by his genuine, oblivious support for their love. This sets the stage for a celebration that is both a personal joy and a political statement of unity.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Rhythms of a Shared Life**\r\nIn a quieter moment, the complex tapestry of relationships is explored. Robin accompanies Lingsha to the evening market, learning of the daily routine Lingsha shares with Caelus. This leads to a profound conversation where Lingsha assures Robin that they are not rivals, but partners in loving Caelus, each having their own unique rhythms and spaces with him. They are building a family together. This theme is reinforced at the training grounds, where Caelus's \"humiliation\" at being bested by his own students is revealed as his greatest triumph: proof that humanity can learn to stand beside him, not just behind him.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Language of Care**\r\nThe arc culminates in an intimate evening where the threads of love, family, and communication are woven together. Over a meal Caelus prepares, Liora recounts her \"traumatic\" trip to Hell, where Caelus's endless cooking lectures forced her to develop an \"emergency kiss-intervention\" protocol. The strategy is deployed again when Caelus begins lecturing, leaving him flustered but loved. Robin then delivers the wedding invitation, which leads to a gentle but direct confrontation about the meaning behind all the \"tactical\" kisses and shared beds. Overwhelmed but willing, Caelus asks for a future conversation about what it truly means to be \"theirs.\" As the four settle into sleep, the unspoken promises between them feel as weighty and real as any formal vow, cementing their unique and chosen family on the eve of a new beginning.\r\n\r\n## Arc The Unfolding Heart (Ch. 329 - 336)\r\n\r\nIn the serene aftermath of a royal wedding, the threads of Caelus's life begin to weave a more profound tapestry. After moving the entire congregation with a divinely-touched speech, he remains blissfully unaware of the miracle he inspired, accepting a lifetime of free noodles from a grateful family as simple kindness. During the celebration, a bed of blue iris flowers sparks a memory of his near-death, a silent testament to the goddess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watchful presence. The bonds around him tighten when a deliberately fumbled bouquet toss lands in the shared hands of Robin and Lingsha, a public symbol of their shared intention that everyone but Caelus understands.\r\n\r\nThis season of vows and revelations pushes Caelus to become the pillar of trust his found family needs. He helps Robin and Lingsha out of their intricate formal wear, a mortifying yet intimate act that they frame as the ultimate demonstration of their faith in him. A simple tour of the city with the insightful Celestine leads to a breathtaking flight above the clouds, where he shares the sacred geography of the heavens with her and Lingsha, offering a perspective that makes all earthly burdens feel light.\r\n\r\nYet, the past is not so easily quieted. During a quiet walk through the evening market, a shared memory of pain and a first meal echoes through Caelus and Robin's soul bond. This memory inspires Caelus to create a blueberry soup that, unbeknownst to him, becomes a vessel of pure emotion. With each spoonful, their family tastes the harrowing truth of his suffering, her rescue, and their hard-won survival, moving them all to tears. That night, Robin answers the unspoken questions by singing their story from the balcony\u00e2\u20ac\u201da raw ballad of her gilded cage, his near-fatal beating, and the desperate, bloody kiss she gave him as he battled the curse's backlash.\r\n\r\nFinally hearing the full weight of the pain she endured for him, Caelus is left speechless with gratitude and guilt. As the heavy emotions of the night threaten to overwhelm them, he masterfully lightens the mood, regaling Liora and Lingsha with hilarious tales of their early, disastrous adventures as a fledgling Hero Party. Laughter fills the chamber, healing the old wounds laid bare, and Caelus falls asleep surrounded by his family, finally feeling the profound truth of being chosen and loved.\r\n\r\n### Arc The Coordinator's Burden Ch 337 - 344\r\n\r\nIn the wake of celebration, Prince Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peace is shattered by a crisis. A horde of monstrous sand worms, driven from their territory by an unknown terror, threatens a royal convoy. Guided by the strategic demon lord Liora, Sunday faces a brutal lesson: to prepare for the coming apocalyptic war, he can no longer rely solely on the Hero, Caelus, for every threat. He must learn to command.\r\n\r\nWhen scouts discover a demon fortress being built in the wastelands, Sunday seizes the test. He deploys a new, untested military squad backed by veteran adventurers, making the calculated decision to prove humanity can fight its own battles. The operation is a tactical success, showcasing brilliant coordination that overwhelms the demons. But victory comes with a cost\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfour adventurers die under his command.\r\n\r\nHaunted by the loss, Sunday honors the fallen with personal letters, vowing never to see casualties as mere statistics. Exhausted and burdened, he is found by Caelus and Princess Robin, who force him to rest and remember his own humanity. Through this, Sunday learns his true strength isn't in carrying the world alone, but in accepting the help of those who stand with him, sharing the impossible weight of command.\r\n\r\n## Arc (345 - 365 )\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Heart's Unspoken Dawn**\r\n\r\nIn the quiet dawn of Sunstone, the hero Caelus navigates the tender complexities of a family bound by love and trauma. After a heavy decision to return to the city of his death, Lumora, he and the immortal Liora embark on a two-day journey to Valcrest. There, their relationship transforms through a playful yet profound \"challenge\" of public affection(at the end caelus won), helping Liora overcome the fear born from his past death. Their intimate competition, culminating in a secret sky-dance and a first caelus deliberate kiss above the clouds, forges a deeper bond. Upon returning home, their newfound happiness is met with knowing smiles from Robin and Lingsha, who piece together the truth through their soul bond. In a series of gentle evening conversations, the three women solidify their unconditional support, creating a family strong enough to hold private joys and shared love, allowing Caelus to reflect that, in their unique world, everyone has already won.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: Letters and Roads (Ch. 366 - 373)\r\n\r\nIn the hush of the guild hall, two women\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin and Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare handed a choice that weighs heavier than any sword. Princess Seraphine of Ashenvale has written a letter, not of politics but of love, to Caelus, the man both women quietly cherish. Sunday, their commander, entrusts them with the power to decide how to answer. Torn between love and honor, they realize they cannot speak for his heart until they face their own. With trembling resolve, they write their replies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot as rivals, but as women who will not hide anymore. Their words to Seraphine are honest, raw, and brave; they do not deny her, nor do they yield. That night, they promise to one another: after their next journey, they will confess to Caelus and let him choose.\r\n\r\nTheir journey begins with laughter, tangled limbs, and sleepy affection. Caelus, ever unaware of the storm beneath his companions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 smiles, drives the carriage toward Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201da land of memories and wounds. Along the way, they rest in Thornhaven, where an old friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warmth reminds Caelus of the kindness he once gave as a boy. In a hidden garden kept alive for seventy-three years, Liora reveals her sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u201da living memory of gratitude and love. By inviting them into this sacred space, she welcomes them as family.\r\n\r\nThe following mornings are painted in peace: shared beds, borrowed clothes, and quiet breakfasts cooked with care. Yet in every small joy, the shadow of old pain lingers. Caelus laughs easily but speaks with the weariness of a soul far older than his years. When he calls others \u00e2\u20ac\u0153young,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d his friends see through the cracks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dseeing not a hero, but a boy who forgot how to be one.\r\n\r\nThen, Commander Astraea challenges him to a duel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to worship him, but to remind him of joy. Their blades dance under the morning sun, steel meeting steel in a rhythm of respect and laughter. When Caelus wins, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t triumph that fills the air, but connection. For once, he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the unreachable Hero\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust a man, seen and understood.\r\n\r\nWhen the road calls again, the group departs, bantering and bickering as family does. Behind them, Thornhaven thrives with new purpose. Soldiers train harder, inspired by a hero who fought like one of them. And in the royal castle, King Mordain and his kin resolve to do what kingdoms rarely do\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprotect, not use, the Hero who has given them everything.\r\n\r\nThus continues the quiet march toward Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe road of memory, love, and letters unwritten.\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Gates of Memory (Ch. 374 - 394 )\r\n\r\nThe road to Lumora begins with laughter and closeness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe four heroes packed together on the driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bench, choosing warmth over comfort. Caelus, too used to making himself small, apologizes for taking up space, only to be told, softly and surely, that he belongs. Safe among them, he sleeps for once without fear.\r\n\r\nLumora greets them not as warriors, but as family returning home. Yet within its quiet streets lies the weight of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe place of his sacrifice and rebirth. It is here, beside the fountain where his blood once fell, that he breaks at last, this fountain named Irish fountain, because many irish flowers is bloom here unaturaly, because solara who allow the flower bloom on that place.and in this place, caelus confesses to the goddess Solara that being human terrifies him more than any war\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat love feels heavier than any blade. Solara answers, not with command, but with grace. She tells him he was never meant to carry the world alone, only to light it\u00e2\u20ac\u201done heart at a time. When her voice fades, she leaves behind a single glowing iris and the understanding that salvation lies in trust, not solitude.\r\n\r\nRobin, Liora, and Lingsha find him soon after, collapsing into his arms with relief and tears. Their embrace says what words cannot: he is not alone. The goddess herself smiles down from her statue, the stone transformed into warmth. Even the heavens seem to breathe easier.\r\n\r\nThat night, crowded again into one bed, they reclaim a small human comfort. Caelus admits, haltingly, that he needs permission\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be honest, to say when he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t okay. They give it freely. For the first time, he accepts it. The next day becomes a celebration of life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small miracles: a shared breakfast from Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loving hands, laughter over messy hair and spilled tea, and the gift of a handmade doll shaped like Caelus himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproof that even miracles can be held.\r\n\r\nWhen evening comes, they seek the onsen, where steam and starlight blur the line between sacred and silly. A game of truth or dare fills the air with laughter; walls fall, replaced by honest joy. Even when a misplaced towel sparks chaos, it ends in shared laughter and a meal cooked with care\u00e2\u20ac\u201da quiet declaration that love and normalcy are worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nThen, under a sky scattered with gold, Caelus keeps a promise. He takes Celestine flying, his divine wings shedding light over Lumora like blessings. In the clouds, they dance\u00e2\u20ac\u201da freefall of faith and exhilaration. Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust in him becomes a mirror, teaching him what it means to be seen, to be loved without divinity. When they return, their family welcomes them back with teasing, warmth, and another inevitable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sleep pile,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where even Celestine finds a place among them.\r\n\r\nBy the time they leave Lumora, Caelus has changed. The city that once held his death now bears witness to his life\u00e2\u20ac\u201dits people smiling under the feathers of his light, its goddess smiling down upon her fragile, beloved spark. And though letters of fate await him in Solphire, for now, on the quiet road home, Caelus is simply human\u00e2\u20ac\u201dheld, trusted, and finally, free to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Weight of Love and the Geometry of Oblivion (Ch. 395 - 409)\r\n\r\nIn the heart of Solphire, five days before a princess arrives to claim a hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand, love trembles on the edge of disaster. Robin and Lingsha know that if Caelus ever truly understands the depth of their love, he will vanish from existence to spare them grief. The Time Lord Kronos has shown Robin this future\u00e2\u20ac\u201da garden where happiness never was, and a world where memory itself forgets him. And so, they choose silence.\r\n\r\nBound by the cruel mercy of that knowledge, Robin, Lingsha, and Liora weave a lie of light: they will love Caelus only as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d masking devotion as comfort, and longing as laughter. Robin tests fate first, dressed in the silk of temptation, but Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obliviousness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis divine safeguard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dturns her seduction into an innocent slumber, where she becomes not his lover, but his pillow. When dawn comes, his jealousy flares at her dress, fierce and uncomprehending, a mark of love that cannot be named. She smiles through tears, accepting crumbs of intimacy from a man who would burn his own soul for them.\r\n\r\nAs days pass, their fragile equilibrium blooms into absurd warmth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstolen noodles at breakfast, laughter through exhaustion, shared dreams of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the perfect pillow.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Yet beneath it all lies the ticking promise of the princess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival. When Robin and Liora finally tell Caelus about Seraphine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal, he spirals into self-doubt, unable to see the worth they see in him. Robin, trembling but brave, blesses her rival\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pursuit and faces heartbreak with grace worthy of a queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the muddy fields beyond the castle, the hero finds his answer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot in grand gestures or divine signs, but in the birth of twelve piglets, his wings smeared with dirt, his smile radiant in its simplicity. When Robin finds him there, caked in earth and light, she understands: this is love\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot the consuming fire Kronos warned of, but the quiet miracle of choosing the present, no matter how fragile.\r\n\r\nHand in hand, they walk home through the dusk, carrying the weight of love that must never be spoken, and the geometry of a happiness shaped entirely by what must remain unsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Architecture of Sanctuary and the Weight of Kindness (Ch. 409 - 427 )\r\n\r\nIn the days following the Princess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival, the kingdom breathes in quiet chaos. Caelus, the oblivious hero who carries divinity like a burden, returns from helping deliver twelve piglets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis divine wings still streaked with mud. Robin cannot help but laugh and love him for it, seeing in his absurdity a kind of sacred honesty. They hold hands, and though he understands nothing of the love in her touch, she feels everything.\r\n\r\nTheir world turns through moments of accidental intimacy and ridiculous grace. Lingsha collapses from exhaustion, Seraphine laughs at noodle wars, and the castle becomes a theater of tenderness disguised as comedy. Even the most catastrophic accident\u00e2\u20ac\u201da wrong door opened, a naked misunderstanding\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecomes a pact of silent solidarity. They keep each other's secrets as they keep each other alive.\r\n\r\nSeraphine, carrying the weight of command and the tremor of forty-three names she cannot forget, finds solace not in courtrooms or councils but in a bowl of mint noodles, a table full of laughter, and a family that refuses to let anyone drown alone. Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of her proposal breaks her heart but saves her soul; his cruel kindness teaches her that love\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truest form is protection. Through shared tears and laughter, she joins their variant family\u00e2\u20ac\u201da circle where belonging is earned through compassion, not romance.\r\n\r\nWhen the war princess departs, she carries with her a simple, handmade necklace\u00e2\u20ac\u201done imperfect golden feather\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the quiet understanding that rejection is not exile. Behind her, the hero collapses into Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arms, undone by guilt he calls cruelty, though it is mercy. They hold him until he sleeps, the three women forming a fortress of warmth around the boy who would destroy himself to keep them smiling.\r\n\r\nBy the time dawn comes again, Solphire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s halls are quieter, the weight shared and diffused among hearts bound by choice. And in that fragile peace\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmud-streaked, laughter-stained, and stitched together with kindness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtheir strange, imperfect family endures, proving that sometimes love survives best when it refuses to be named.\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Architecture of War and the Weight of Absence (Ch. 428 - 434 )\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of an approaching war, the kingdoms gather beneath one shared vow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto protect the hero by fighting without him. Prince Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s council resolves that this battle, for once, will not rest on Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoulders. Robin is chosen to command, her heart steady with fear and faith alike. Their mission is not merely to win, but to prove to the boy who carries heaven in his scars that humanity can stand on its own, that his worth is not measured in sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFar from the council chamber, Celestine rides toward Thornhaven, clutching the soft doll she stitched to remember him. Terror coils in her chest, the memory of his death and her miracle of resurrection too raw to silence. Around her, the other priestesses form a circle of prayer and resolve, teaching her the very truth he taught them all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat strength does not mean solitude. When they arrive, the warmth of a noodle stall run by Serra and Elara enfolds her like a homecoming. Between laughter and bowls of steaming broth, she remembers why they fight: to build a world where Caelus can finally rest.\r\n\r\nAt the war council, the leaders of every allied nation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwarriors, royals, commanders\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpledge their forces to a plan that values unity over glory. The armies train in agony, breaking and rebuilding themselves under the merciless guidance of Astraea and Gareth, their sweat and suffering hammering them into one body of endurance. Celestine learns to heal through exhaustion, to see every wound as a promise: pain now to prevent despair later. The commanders, hollow-eyed with guilt at their own severity, find solace only when Celestine drags them back to Serra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stall, where laughter over noodles softens the sharp edge of duty.\r\n\r\nAnd on one sleepless night, under Thornhaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pale lanterns, Celestine collides with Princess Seraphine. Two women, bound by love for the same oblivious man, find one another in quiet understanding. The Caelus doll and the golden feather rest between them on the table\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsymbols of resurrection and rejection, of hope and heartbreak shared. They speak softly of war, of fear, of the man who gave them both faith to keep walking forward. When dawn comes, neither victory nor death has yet arrived, but the world already feels changed: love and courage, like armies, have learned to march together.\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Architecture of Humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Refusal (Ch. 435 - 445)**\r\n\r\nThe army of eighteen thousand gathered beneath the pale light of Thornhaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dawn, trembling not with fear but with purpose, as king and princes spoke of duty, sacrifice, and the fragile hope that humanity might stand tall without the Hero who had so often carried their burdens. With these words etched into their spirits, the soldiers marched toward the demon fortress, their boots echoing the promise of a new destiny. At the staging grounds, Prince Sunday revealed the quiet terror hidden beneath their advance: a crystal linked to Liora, and the knowledge that Caelus would descend onto the battlefield only if half their force died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan ultimate contingency none of them wished to see unfold. Celestine carried this weight the heaviest, clutching her tiny Caelus doll as she prayed for strength and survival before stepping into hell.\r\n\r\nDawn broke like a held breath when Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spearhead slipped silently into the fortress, eliminating sentries with surgical grace and opening the gate to humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first victory. With Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge flowing through Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s command, demons fell like pieces on a board whose moves had been read long before they were made. Even as ten generals descended and later thirty more, Astraea, Gareth, Elite Squad Seven, and the vanguard fought like a single, perfect machine strengthened by Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relentless healing and blessings, their coordination a tapestry woven from sweat, blood, and the hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lessons. But victory was never clean. Celestine tasted the first bitter deaths she could not prevent, and as exhaustion crushed her ribs like iron bands, she dreamed of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle, proud, and impossibly kind\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbefore waking once again into the fire.\r\n\r\nThe fire only deepened when fifty generals arrived, and then five thousand lesser demons swarmed from the rear, surrounding the humans in a ring of snarling, clawed death. For hours their lines buckled but never broke, and when Sunday whispered his final gamble, the battlefield changed. Celestine stacked blessing upon blessing until Astraea shimmered like a goddess of war, her golden silhouette searing panic into demon hearts as Gareth cried out that the Hero had come. In terror of Caelus, demon coordination shattered, and humanity surged forward, breaking the siege under the weight of a lie crafted from faith. But the victory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price was carved into the ground: Astraea collapsing, Celestine finally giving out, soldiers standing only because they had forgotten how to fall.\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Sunday finally approached the blood-stained courtyard, his weary smile said what no trumpet could. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he whispered to Gareth, and that was all it took\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe man collapsed with the grace of a felled tree, followed by the entirety of Elite Squad Seven whose bodies had simply waited for permission to stop. Commander Helena\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice roared the official truth to the sky: the fortress was captured, the war was over, and humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u201daching, trembling, but unbroken\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhad proven itself at last. As Sunday sent word that their casualties never reached the dreaded threshold, he allowed himself one quiet thought: that Caelus had been right to trust them, and that for the first time, humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory was truly its own.\r\n\r\nThis operation is being called \"Dawn Reach.\" humanity operation without hero party help. \r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Healing, Family, and the Quiet Shape of Love (Ch. 446 - 459)**\r\n\r\nCelestine awoke to a body that felt borrowed from death, every breath a reminder of the battlefield she had survived. The Caelus doll beside her carried the warmth of a dream she dared not speak\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe kissed it once more, a quiet confession to fabric. And of course, fate arranged the real Caelus to walk in at that precise moment. Mortified beyond language, she listened as he completely misunderstood, believing she had been trying to *eat* the doll out of hunger. Her stomach, traitorous and loud, confirmed the misconception. And so the greatest hero alive fed the broken priestess with cheerful \u00e2\u20ac\u0153choo-choo\u00e2\u20ac\u009d noises, treating her not as a burden but as family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsomething both more and less than she wished for.\r\n\r\nHe made the same rounds to Astraea wrapped like a stubborn mummy and an exhausted Sunday whose brain was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153filing for divorce,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d applying absurdity as both medicine and mercy. Liora, recognizing Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hidden feelings, guarded her dignity with strategic lies and quiet understanding. Soon their mornings were filled with shared cooking, affectionate bickering, and a growing absurd ritual of feeding Celestine with airplane and rocket noises that softened her shame into laughter. When she asked Caelus to stay until she slept, he agreed without hesitation, unaware that his presence meant more to her than any miracle she could cast.\r\n\r\nBut healing was not gentle. Caelus, following Sister Mira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orders, washed Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battered body with trembling hands, forced to confront the brutal truth of what she endured for him. She held his gaze, refusing to let him drown in guilt while admitting, in a whisper slipping past the boundaries of medical necessity, that she kissed the doll because she could not kiss him. The revelation cracked something in him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot realization, but the first quiet shift of a heart beginning to see.\r\n\r\nDays passed in fragile progress. Caelus walked beside her at a glacial pace\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis unimaginable speed reduced to slow, meditative steps because she needed slow. When she stumbled, he caught her instantly, holding her with a panic so pure she understood that his love existed, even if he only knew how to name it as family. The Hero Party reunited soon after, Robin and Lingsha collapsing around Caelus with a fury of affection and a hilarious decree that the Caelus dolls must be preserved as historical artifacts of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confused puppy nature.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Tactical affection warfare followed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dkiss attacks, dragon-noise feeding, and the mortification of a hero entirely defeated by four determined women who loved him shamelessly.\r\n\r\nCelestine found healing not just in medicine but in this chaotic, ridiculous warmth. Caelus learned medical care under Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheerful instruction, discovering that devotion was a skill he already possessed in abundance. In return, Celestine learned that being cared for was not weakness but a promise: she was loved, essential, chosen.\r\n\r\nAs the command council named the captured fortress **Dawn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reach**, the soldiers who survived were granted legacy and honor. Yet Caelus saw only the twenty-eight who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it, unable to absolve himself. He needed reassurance as much as those he tended to, and Celestine offered it gently, choosing her wish carefully: that he remain in her life as family, as someone she could visit, someone who would cook for her\u00e2\u20ac\u201da wish safe enough to grant, and honest enough to keep her heart from breaking.\r\n\r\nTheir journey home was interrupted by wyverns, which Caelus resolved not by battle but by playing with them in the sky like an overjoyed child until even apex predators tired before he did. Soldiers applauded; Liora dragged him back into the carriage; Celestine watched him with the tired fondness of someone deeply, helplessly in love.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to Thornhaven, the city roared their victory. Caelus carried Celestine through the cheering crowds in a princess carry that nearly killed her with embarrassment and revived her with happiness. Sister Mira, seeing everything Celestine tried to hide, declared the medical ward full and assigned her to the Hero Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suite\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere she would be safest, most loved, most wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd so Celestine let herself be carried back, held gently by the man who had no idea he was carrying her heart with her body. Around her waited family, chosen through fire, absurdity, and devotion. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the romantic love she longed for\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot yet\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut it was real, warm, and enough to keep her moving forward.\r\n\r\nA love story growing not through declarations, but through care; not through destiny, but through every slow, patient step they took together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Worth, Divinity, and the Fight to Keep Him Alive (Ch. 460 - 472)**\r\n\r\nThe castle kitchen became Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private heaven, a place so perfect he nearly pledged allegiance to Valcrest on the spot. As the women bathed, he cooked them five dishes shaped from shared memories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmint soup, blueberry soup, rice balls, noodles\u00e2\u20ac\u201deach a quiet echo of lives they had built together. Gratitude overwhelmed the table; Robin kissed him, Lingsha kissed him, Liora kissed him, and Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshaking but resolute\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgave him her first kiss with a whisper of thanks for being alive. The hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain promptly collapsed, and he fled to the bed like an embarrassed puppy with four women laughing around him as they claimed him as their pillow. The next day, conspiracy bloomed in the throne room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadows. Caelus would never accept recognition, so they deceived him with a simple request: help Celestine walk for her healing commendation. He agreed without suspicion, guiding her with glacial patience until they stepped into the ceremony where Astraea waited like a predator that had finally cornered its prey. Celestine was honored first, saving over four hundred lives. Then came Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwho tried to flee but was physically anchored by his family as Astraea ordered him to stand. Soldiers shouted their gratitude, declaring his doctrine the reason they survived. The medal pinned to his chest did not change his humility, but it cracked his certainty that his worth was nothing. That night, walking with Robin, he forgave the deception gently, calling it bitter medicine. And in that soft breath, he admitted something far more dangerous: he believed he was better suited to teaching than to being a hero, and he was now preparing a doctrine to help humanity survive the Demon King\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause he did not think he would be alive when Valthor returned. Soon he demonstrated what fighting Valthor meant. He reconstructed his death with terrifying precision\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfive percent of Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength shattered stone, and his divine form\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing intent froze even elite soldiers. With six blessings, he moved like an apocalyptic storm; with forty-seven blessings, he carved through a mountain and created a tunnel by turning swords into flying extensions of his will. Each act terrified his observers not because of its power but because of how calmly he used it, as if planning for a world where he no longer existed. This culminated in the doctrine he called **Final Defiance**: teaching soldiers how to accept their death and make it matter. Survival was not the goal; meaningful sacrifice was. His family realized then that all of his teaching, all of his planning, all of his careful documentation pointed toward one conclusion\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus had accepted he would die, and everything he did now was preparation for a world without him. Liora was the first to break. She put him to sleep with herbs and enchantment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle, merciful\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause she could no longer bear the mask he wore. She confessed her agony to the others, her voice trembling as she explained that Caelus only allowed himself to relax when he had accepted death as inevitable. His peace was not peace at all; it was resignation. Robin cried, Lingsha shook, Celestine froze. And Liora, trembling with fury and love, declared that she refused the future he had chosen. She refused a world where he died and they survived. She refused to let him go gently into the role of a tool or a sacrifice. If Caelus planned for his death, then they would plan for his life. They would teach him greed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot for victory, nor strategy, nor utility\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut for himself. For love, for belonging, for mornings and meals and laughter. They would make him selfish, piece by piece, until he wanted to live for reasons that had nothing to do with saving anyone. The doctrine of Final Defiance might prepare humanity for Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\r\nbut the women who loved Caelus prepared themselves for something far more impossible:\r\n**saving the hero who was already planning to die.**\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Borrowed Dreams and the Awakening of a Selfish Heart (Ch. 473 - 488 )**\r\n\r\nCaelus slept surrounded by the four women who loved him, unaware of their tear-stained resolve as Liora asked to borrow their memories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to invade, but to weave a dream strong enough to shake a man who had quietly accepted his own death. With unanimous consent, she pulled him into a dream where he wandered an abandoned castle in Hell armed with nothing but ingredients and a carrot shaped like a sword. Instead of fear, Caelus responded with joy, deciding the lonely owner clearly needed a warm meal. When Liora revealed herself as the castle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistress, he scolded her for neglecting her kitchen and cooked until she wept at the taste of being cared for. A tour of her home led to the revelation of her most treasured carving, a crude wooden bird in a display case\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand in a panic of accidental magic and carrot-thoughts, Caelus transformed it, and her entire wardrobe, into carrot versions. Expecting righteous divine vengeance, he confessed everything and offered his carrot-sword as apology, only to be met with a kiss to the cheek, a laugh that broke centuries of loneliness, and the realization that the treasure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meaning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot its form\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas eternal. She tied the carrot around her neck and accepted him as her little brother, the title spoken with trembling joy.\r\nBut Liora had more to show. She took him across dimensions to witness a world where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never existed\u00e2\u20ac\u201da nightmare of empty halls, stale noodles, and a demon lord slowly collapsing under the weight of her own solitude. Caelus shattered the dimensional barrier with raw refusal and embraced the alternate Liora, promising she would never endure that darkness. He did the same when he saw Robin, broken in her cage of grief, stepping toward a fatal fall; he broke through worlds to catch her, because he could not bear the thought of losing her. More memories followed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLingsha exploited and alone in the temple, Celestine sewing dolls to prove he still lived, and the small noodle stall where his kindness healed corruption and reunited friends. He watched Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secret breakdowns, saw Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trembling hands sewing comfort into cloth, and felt the pain he had unknowingly caused simply by planning to die.\r\nAt last, Liora pulled him into his own most sacred memory: Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine garden beneath the impossible moon, the place he went when he died. Caelus broke open there, sobbing that he did not deserve such devotion, that he was flawed, weak, and insufficient. Liora held him as she spoke the truth he had always refused to hear\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat love does not require perfection, only presence. That living, not dying, was the expression of love they needed from him. That his life was the axis of their worlds, and his death would destroy them more thoroughly than any demon king. And finally\u00e2\u20ac\u201dslowly, tremulously\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus whispered the words that changed everything: *\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to live.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d*\r\nHe named his wants with shy honesty: to be spoiled by Liora, to pinch Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeks, to have silly hot-spring conversations with Lingsha, to watch Celestine almost eat the doll again. They were small things, ordinary things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they were proof he had finally allowed himself permission to be greedy for tomorrow. When the dream dissolved, even Solara herself smiled at Liora with gratitude, for accomplishing what the goddess could not.\r\nCaelus awoke lighter, though unable to remember why, and the women gathered around him with a new mission: to protect the selfishness he had finally claimed, to remind him every day that living was not a burden but a choice worth making. At breakfast, surrounded by carrot-shaped dishes and nervous love, Caelus blushed, threatened to pinch Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeks, and took another small step toward the future he had believed he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve. And for the first time, the people who loved him felt the unbearable weight of grief finally shift\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause their hero had chosen to stay, not out of duty, but out of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Victory and the Warmth of Home (Ch. 489 - 500)**\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of preparation, Caelus stands as the living test for the newly forged Anti-Valthor Doctrine. In a historic demonstration, he faces Elite Squad Seven at five percent of the Demon King's power, not as an invincible god, but as a teacher. Through immense sacrifice and a suicidal charge, the squad achieves the impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey land a blow that forces the divine form to its knees, proving for the first time that Valthor can be defeated. The victory sends a shockwave of tangible hope through the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut for Caelus, the harder battle begins afterward. Forced into recovery by his family, he confronts an enemy far more daunting than combat: learning to accept care and believe in his own worth without having to earn it. Through a coordinated campaign of \"spoiling\" him\u00e2\u20ac\u201denforcing rest, sharing meals, and playful challenges\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLiora, Robin, and the others guide him toward understanding that his value is inherent. The arc culminates in days of gentle chaos: shared noodles under the city lights, strategic kisses deployed as punishment, and a quiet, heartfelt haircut that reveals the handsome hero beneath the dust of his duties. In the warmth of his family's love, Caelus learns that true strength lies not only in standing against a god, but in finally allowing himself to be cherished.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of a New Dawn (Ch. 501 - 510 )**\r\n\r\nWith the Anti-Valthor Doctrine proven viable, a new, heavier burden falls upon Caelus and his companions. The victory at five percent power has ignited a fire of hope, resulting in an overwhelming flood of fifteen hundred volunteers. Caelus understands that true strength requires not just skill, but unshakable resolve. To forge this new army, he must first break their spirits with a terrifying truth.\r\n\r\nBefore this solemn duty, the Hero Party shares one last stretch of their unique, chaotic normalcy with Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u201da day that hilariously culminates in the dignified, distinguished Caelus professionally delivering piglets in a muddy pen. But the memory of this warmth is soon eclipsed by the cold reality of their mission.\r\n\r\nStanding before the vast assembly of hopefuls, a visibly nervous Caelus transforms. He becomes a being of pure, crushing radiance, unleashing fifteen percent of a god's power not as a display, but as a visceral, soul-shaking test. The calculated demonstration of terror and the brutal honesty of the veteran commanders lay bare the horrific cost of the path they are choosing. Yet, from the dissolving divine energy and the trembling volunteers, a new resolve is born. Caelus, no longer just a warrior but a mentor, extends a challenge not to a god, but to humanity itself: to stand, to fight, and to become heroes together. The dawn of this new army is forged not in comfort, but in the shared, heavy weight of a truth they have now chosen to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Home and the Hope of Dawn (Ch. 511 - 522)**\r\n\r\nAs the new Anti-Valthor Doctrine is put to the test for the first time, the Hero Party is separated. Lingsha and Commander Astraea lead a flawless, casualty-free mission, proving that humanity can now stand against demonic threats without their central pillar. But back in Sunstone, that pillar is showing cracks. Caelus, the seemingly invincible hero, suffers a sudden, public collapse from the permanent neurological damage of an old curse, a stark reminder of the fragile man beneath the divine power.\r\n\r\nYet, this vulnerability only strengthens the bonds of the family he built. Through a soul-deep connection, Lingsha feels his pain across the distance, using the certainty of his care as her own anchor. Robin returns from royal duties, finding solace not in power, but in the simple act of sharing a meal with him. And in quiet moments, Celestine and Caelus share stories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtales of tragic fate that he defiantly rewrites into narratives of hope and survival.\r\n\r\nThe arc culminates not on a battlefield, but around a pot of custom noodles, a promise kept. As an exhausted Lingsha breaks down in tears of relief, Caelus, in his profoundly oblivious way, offers them all a future\u00e2\u20ac\u201da rewritten story where they grow old together(dawn keeper kael, and starweaver). In proving they can fight without him, his family finally gives him the one thing he needs most: a reason to believe he can live for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Shattered Gods and Unspoken Hearts (Arc 523 - 530)**\r\n\r\nIn a historic assessment, a veteran squad named Ironshrine, forged in personal tragedy, steps onto the training ground not just to pass a test, but to challenge divinity itself. Their leader, William, who lost his family to Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mere presence, demands that Caelus stop holding back and show them the true face of a god\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power. In a stunning, brutal confrontation, the squad achieves the impossible: by pinning his divine wings and overloading their blessings, they shatter Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s godly form, stripping him back to a bleeding, mortal man and proving for the first time that godhood has a breaking point.\r\n\r\nThis revolutionary victory sends ripples through the military, but for Caelus, it brings a new, humbling vulnerability. As he recovers, his family surrounds him with a different kind of battle\u00e2\u20ac\u201done of peaceful barbecues, playful games, and his own profound, cookie-obsessed obliviousness. During a game of Truth or Dare, the carefully maintained silence around their hearts is broken, forcing the women to confess they are single because their love is reserved for him. And in a fleeting, sake-induced moment of clarity, a confident Caelus reveals he is not as oblivious as he seems, consciously processing their love before the amnesia of sobriety returns him to his gentle, uncertain self. The arc closes on a world forever changed: where gods can be broken on the battlefield, and a hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart, though shielded by trauma, is slowly learning to beat in time with the loves he now knows are there.\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of a Million Deaths and the Architecture of Love That Refuses to Break (Ch. 531 - 534)**\r\n\r\nThe night begins with a scream that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a scream at all\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breath caught between a million dying throats. The Solareth curse drags him through borrowed bodies like a storm through windows: a farmer watching his family die, a soldier crushed by a leviathan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail, a mother felled protecting her children, a woman suffocating beneath a collapsing world. Thousands, then millions. Every heartbeat becomes a grave. He cannot move. He cannot breathe. He becomes death so many times that the concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self\u00e2\u20ac\u009d dissolves.\r\n\r\nBut his family hears him drowning. Liora is the first to reach him, taking half the curse into her demon-born mind until blood pours from her eyes and ears. Lingsha and Celestine pin his thrashing limbs with divine strength, chanting blessings that shatter against the curse like glass. And Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dterrified, resolute\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclimbs onto his chest and kisses him with the full force of her magic, anchoring him with the taste of blood and devotion. Ten minutes of hell pass, and when his eyes finally open, the first thing he does is apologize. The women smother him in furious affection, refusing to let him take blame for suffering he never chose. They clean the blood, rearrange the sheets, and sleep around him like a fortress built on bruised love.\r\n\r\nMorning comes gently, but Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guilt wakes first. Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split lip and the fading bruises around her mouth break something in him, yet she smiles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoft, battered, unrepentant\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclaiming she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d kiss him through a million more nightmares if it meant he lived. The others echo her defiance, overriding his protests with a single truth: he is theirs, and their choice to carry him is not a debt he owes, but love they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surrender. They strip him of shame as they bathe him tenderly, treating his body not as wounded divinity but as someone precious, someone worth caring for.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast, they serve him a meal crafted for a recovering soul\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle porridge, careful broth, and juices chosen with surgeon-like precision. Caelus thanks them with his whole heart, but another duty pulls at him: a message carried through death itself. Through the curse, he lived the final moments of Kana, Commander William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe terror, the love, the apology, the grief. He delivers her last thoughts to the man she died thinking of. William collapses, not in despair, but in relief at a wound finally allowed to close.\r\n\r\nThe women stand behind Caelus as he speaks, grounding him as he becomes what the curse has made him: the keeper of last testaments, the witness to the dying, the bridge between memory and peace. And though the curse will return\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnight after night, death after death\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey vow to meet it with blood, with kisses, with stubborn love. For as long as he survives, they will be there. And surviving, for now, is enough.\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Throne That Must Be Overthrown (Ch. 535 - 540)**\r\n\r\nThe morning begins with the crack of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s halo and the roar of three thousand soldiers watching him stand alone in godhood. For four hours he becomes their living standard, letting ten squads strike him not as a hero, but as a teacher\u00e2\u20ac\u201drevealing weakness, testing doctrine, proving that humanity can rise to meet divinity without dying beneath it. When the assessments end, he staggers, exhausted, and his family catches him the only way they know how: peanut cookies, shared porridge, rotating bath duty, and a bed where he is allowed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfinally, blessedly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be the spoiled center of their world.\r\n\r\nBut the training does not end with ten squads. It expands into three thousand. Robin and Sunday reveal the next impossible objective: the soldiers must learn to defeat Caelus at fifteen percent power\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe level of a demon lord. Not to dethrone him, but to lift the crown of responsibility from his shoulders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make you obsolete,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Sunday insists, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so you are allowed to rest.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Caelus doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to answer, but his family does. They vow to build a world where he is no longer the pillar holding up the sky.\r\n\r\nAs logistics unfold and new battle doctrines harden, Celestine prepares to return to Lumora. She and Caelus spend their last night together over noodles from Serra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stall, sharing memories of piglets, miracles, and all the absurd love that binds their family. He feeds her with chopsticks\u00e2\u20ac\u201da ritual of wordless affection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand she realizes that this, too, is his love language. She asks if he loves them; he tries to define the feeling and fails, but answers honestly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess I do. It feels right.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d For her, that is enough.\r\n\r\nDawn brings the final quiet heartbreak. Celestine wakes curled atop Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasured place\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgifted to her for one night. Farewells are soft and aching: Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embrace, Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing, Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gift of the Caelus doll. And last comes Caelus himself, telling her to be selfish, to live, to come back safe. Celestine answers with a single, stolen kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u201dquick, certain, precious\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand names it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u009d before he can unravel its truth.\r\n\r\nShe leaves with the rising sun, clutching the doll against her heart, whispering a promise meant for no ears but her own: that when the war ends, she will return and say the real words. But for now, the world moves toward the battlefield, the throne of godhood waits to be overthrown, and the family he loves prepares to stand for him until he can finally stand for himself.\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of Shared Divinity (Ch. 541 - 554 )**\r\n\r\nIn the quiet wake of Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farewell (celestine return to lumora), Caelus drifts through days thick with unspoken emotion, trying to steady himself by observing the clash between Elite Squad Seven and the newly risen Enhanced Squad. What begins as a simple assessment becomes the moment the world changes: the two squads fight as perfect mirrors, blow for blow, until Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overwhelming blessing is met, contained, and neutralized\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot by equivalent power, but by Gareth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard-earned doctrine. The draw declares a truth the world had never seen before: excellence can be taught, and divinity can be matched.\r\n\r\nBut as the squads celebrate their hard-won parity, Caelus confesses a loneliness born not from weakness, but from standing too high above others. Robin hears the tremor beneath his words and answers not with comfort, but with resolve. When he asks her to join him at dawn to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153test something,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she arrives armed with months of secret training\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a heart steady with devotion.\r\n\r\nTheir experiment begins with failure. His divine halo rejects her utterly. But when she kisses him\u00e2\u20ac\u201da prayer shaped by love, longing, and the simple wish to stand beside him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe impossible breaks open. The halo accepts her. Magic multiplies. Movements synchronize. Two bodies think with one soul. Together, they rise into the sky as a single will, discovering the union Caelus has sought his entire life: strength without loneliness.\r\n\r\nThe revelation blooms into embarrassment, bickering, tomato-red cheeks, and the birth of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tactical Kissing Protocol\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201da requirement Robin calls not a price, but a privilege. Soon, Lingsha too steps into the light, her own prayer unlocking a capability that transforms human warfare: perfect vision, flawless enhancement, and the capacity to raise sixteen soldiers to divine-adjacent heights without cost or strain.\r\n\r\nThe world watches as enhanced squads shatter stone and golden light floods the training ground. Caelus protects them from strategic exploitation, insisting they distribute their knowledge rather than burden Lingsha alone. Exhaustion eventually brings Caelus and Lingsha collapsing onto cold floors, where Robin and Liora feed them like stubborn children\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan act that teaches Caelus that love is not a weight one earns, but a gift one receives.\r\n\r\nIn the days that follow, the four of them form a rhythm that carries a thousand soldiers toward the future: Lingsha sees, Caelus interprets, Liora writes, Robin organizes. Together they work, rest, eat, laugh, and bear the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weight as a family.\r\n\r\nAnd through it all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthrough the perfect mirrors, the divine collisions, the whispered confessions and prayer-kissed miracles\u00e2\u20ac\u201done truth rises above every battlefield:\r\n\r\n**Caelus is no longer alone at the pinnacle.**\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of a Day That Healed the Hero (Active character: Robin and caelus dating) (Ch. Ch. 555 - 567)**\r\n\r\nCaelus woke beneath a heap of warm limbs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora tangled around him like anchors\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand for the first time in years, he realized he had a day with no duties, no soldiers waiting, and no Tactical Kissing Protocol demanding activation. In that unguarded peace, a childhood instinct surfaced: a soft, absentminded whistle he had forgotten existed. The sound shattered Liora, who burst into tears, recognizing it as the melody he used to make before Clearwater burned seventeen years ago. Robin and Lingsha joined her, clinging to him as though that whistle proved that the little boy who once lived for sunshine still survived inside the man burdened by the world.\r\n\r\nWith that reclaimed joy, Caelus cooked breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan innocent orange soup\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich unknowingly carried the memories of his childhood. Each spoonful dragged the women into the vivid echo of a six-year-old boy sharing terrible rice balls with a terrified child-demon Liora beside a riverbank. By the time they returned to the present, all three were crying again, holding Caelus as though his heart had spilled into the bowl.\r\n\r\nThe family fled into the city festival, determined to give him a day without responsibility. They danced\u00e2\u20ac\u201drather, Caelus stepped on every foot within reach\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand their laughter turned every misstep into proof that love was not earned by perfection. When Caelus later promised one of them a sky-dance in his divine form, he unwittingly sparked a competition between Robin, Lingsha, and Liora. Robin won not through strength or strategy, but by understanding what Caelus needed most: the sky not as a battlefield, but as a place of joy.\r\n\r\nThat night, dressed in a simple gown that stole Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breath, Robin flew with him into the heavens. Thornhaven watched as his golden wings shed feathers like falling starlight. Together they tried to make an aurora, but Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s magic alone faltered\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand she asked him, above the world, if he would choose her. Caelus, mortified but resolute, kissed her not for protocol but desire. Their souls fused, and the aurora exploded across the sky, impossibly brilliant, painting Thornhaven in colors the world had no name for. Two more kisses, unified thunder, and they created a miracle that rewrote the night.\r\n\r\nThey descended by turning freefall into dance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus releasing Robin to the wind, then breaking the atmosphere like a comet to catch her perfectly. Suspended above the clouds, they shared an apple mouth-to-mouth, both red with embarrassment, but unwilling to trade the moment for anything.\r\n\r\nBack on the balcony, their family swarmed them for details, and later Thornhaven delivered a feast of gratitude. Robin shared the story, carefully keeping sacred moments private, while Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstill glowing red\u00e2\u20ac\u201date until sleep overtook him.\r\n\r\nMorning brought citizens wishing to thank the Hero who gave them beauty with no military purpose. Caelus accepted their words with quiet humility, and King Mordain invited him to a royal breakfast not as a Hero but as family. There, Elara teased Robin mercilessly about her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boyfriend,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d while Caelus buttered his bread with calm obliviousness, explaining the aurora as mere \u00e2\u20ac\u0153equal experience distribution\u00e2\u20ac\u009d rather than romance. The table erupted in affectionate disbelief, declaring him catastrophically unaware\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut the very reason they loved him.\r\n\r\nAnd so the day that began with a forgotten whistle ended with a family laughing around a breakfast table, watching a hero finally heal, not through triumph or combat, but through the simple, weightless acts of being loved.\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of a World No Longer Carried Alone (Ch. 568 - 575)**\r\n\r\nThe convoy rolled across open fields while Caelus sat in the command carriage, sketching the future of an army that could stand without him. Astraea and Gareth shaped the instruction tiers, Sunday set the monthly challenge thresholds, and Caelus quietly accepted that his divine power must become a *tool*, not a crutch. When a scout reported a demon incursion in Oakridge, he volunteered the Hero Party to intercept\u00e2\u20ac\u201dunaware that this small detour would change far more than tactics.\r\n\r\nCarrying Robin into the sky, he transformed, golden wings bursting wide. She assessed the battlefield below\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but also her own heart. She wanted the unity\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot because of risk, but because she loved him. So she invented a tactical excuse, kissed him softly, and mortified him so thoroughly that a single strand of glowing silk between their mouths nearly unraveled his soul. Unified, they fell upon the demons like a storm. In four minutes and thirty-seven seconds, nothing remained but steam, ice shards, and fleeing silhouettes. Caelus never touched the ground, refusing to teach the world dependence on godhood.\r\n\r\nHigh in the air, Robin braved the question he always avoided: *how do you feel about the kiss?* Caelus confessed his confusion, embarrassment, and the strangling weight of intimacy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut also his trust, and the quiet, trembling truth that he wanted her to be happy. Her answer came with shaking breath: he was her first kiss, her only kiss, and every kiss mattered. Caelus pressed his forehead to hers, sharing his own secret\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kiss during the Solareth curse was his first too\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand gave her permission that changed everything: *kiss me whenever you want, not just when duty demands it.* Her heart broke open. She kissed him again, freely, and he accepted it with a blush hot enough to rival the sun.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn, a warning glow roused him to a greater threat: fourteen thousand demons advancing on the convoy. Caelus surged forward\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut William, of all people, stepped before him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stand down,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he ordered gently. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our turn to protect you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trembling, Caelus watched from the command platform as three thousand soldiers fought with flawless coordination, slaughtering the horde and seven generals in twenty-three minutes. No deaths. Minimal wounds. His doctrine worked. Tears carved silent lines down his face; for the first time, he understood that the world no longer needed him as its shield\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly as its teacher.\r\n\r\nWilliam, who had spent eight years training against the ghost of the Hero, revealed the grief etched into his purpose. He accepted Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to become an instructor, understanding that vengeance against Valthor required an army, not a lone blade. Caelus sparred him publicly, discovering in William a mirrored reflection of his own style\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprecise, relentless, terrifying. Caelus won only through the brutal instincts forged by real death, and William begged him to teach that instinct too.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to Solphire, Caelus descended from the sky carrying Robin in his arms, golden wings scattering light, and the royal family ran to embrace them both. Over a quiet meal, Lingsha spilled the secret: the aurora seen across half the continent had been Caelus and Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing. The King and Queen stared as Caelus tried to explain it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pure atmospheric spell efficiency using the Tactical Kissing Protocol.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Robin simply blushed and whispered that it was the most beautiful moment of her life.\r\n\r\nIn that soft light, their families finally understood: Caelus loved in grand gestures he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize as love, and Robin loved in vows kept close to her heart. Between them stood a bond built from miracles, mortification, and shared firsts\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a world slowly learning to stand without the boy who once believed he had to carry it alone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of an Ordinary Day, Stolen Back from Destiny (Ch. 576 - 584 )**\r\n\r\nCaelus awoke to an itch in his heart\u00e2\u20ac\u201da longing not for power or victory, but for something small, fragile, and human. So he forged a ridiculous plan: he would disguise himself as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kael,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d an ordinary nineteen-year-old trainee, and spend one full day as the little brother of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kela,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a fabricated older sister\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6played by Liora. He pleaded with such raw earnestness that Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ancient composure broke, and she agreed. With a shimmer of appearance-change magic, the Hero and the Demon Lord vanished, leaving behind a dark-haired pair of siblings wandering Solphire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morning streets, sharing noodles from one bowl like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done it their entire lives.\r\n\r\nAt the training grounds, they were late\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddeliberately so\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand Gareth immediately punished them with laps. They laughed through the sweat, savoring the absurd freedom of being yelled at like ordinary soldiers. Sunday recognized them instantly but turned away, silently granting Caelus the impossible gift of anonymity. Between exercises, the two shared a single water bottle, passing it back and forth with easy, domestic familiarity.\r\n\r\nWhen Astraea called for two-against-one sparring, fate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s irony tightened: she chose Kael and Kela to fight her. Even under her escalating power\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfirst enhanced, then blazing with golden, four-stack radiance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe disguised siblings refused to break. Their movements were imperfect but unified, two halves of a bond sealed long before destiny named them hero and demon lord. When their skill threatened to expose them, Liora collapsed into a brilliant performance of exhaustion, and Caelus carried her to the medical tent in genuine worry, their disguise preserved by her theatrics and his instinctive protectiveness.\r\n\r\nTraining ended; the world resumed its bustle. They wandered the evening market like any brother and sister, buying ingredients for dinner and sharing one cup of honey-vanilla ice cream, alternating bites as though the whole universe had shrunk to the space between their smiles. At the hidden passage near their chambers, Caelus faced Liora and whispered a vow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsimple, devastating, utterly sincere: he would love her until death parted them. Liora answered with a vow even older and deeper, a love that had survived seventeen years of silence. With the spell dissolved, they returned to themselves\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand found that Sunday, moved by their attempt at normalcy, had turned their forged identities into *legal* militia registrations, granting them a doorway into ordinary life whenever they needed it.\r\n\r\nThat night, the other two women challenged Liora for the coveted spot on Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest. Fueled by the warmth of the day she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d dreamed of for seventeen years, Liora won. She fell asleep with her cheek over his heart, claiming the steady beat she had guarded from the shadows since he was a child.\r\n\r\nMorning arrived softly: Liora on his chest, Robin curled into his stolen shirt, and Lingsha wrapped around his leg in an unbreakable hold. Caelus couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move even if he wanted to\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Then Sylvia, disguised as a maid but vibrating with excitement, teleported into the room and flung herself onto the pile, trapping the entire Hero Party beneath a mountain of limbs and laughter.\r\n\r\nIt was ordinary. It was absurd. It was perfect.\r\n\r\nIt was the day Caelus stole back from destiny\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand made his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Chapter 585: The Weight of Natural Urgency, Demonic Politics, and the Meeting That Required His Presence\r\n\r\nAfter thirty minutes of forced immobility, Caelus finally breaks the silence, stating he must urgently use the bathroom, forcing the four women to extract themselves with embarrassed haste. Liora and Sylvia then shift to business. Sylvia explains her visit is for three reasons: a minor territorial dispute in Hell, succubus follower problems, and most importantly, a demon lord named Azrith, Lord of the Shattered Peaks, who is refusing to join Valthor's army. Azrith wants to meet Liora to negotiate neutrality and, critically, wants Caelus to attend to directly assess his capability to determine if neutrality is the prudent survival choice. Caelus accepts the evening departure to Hell with Liora, agreeing to handle the politics, and Robin and Lingsha agree to manage all palace obligations during their brief absence.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 586: The Weight of Separated Duties, Hell's Kitchen, and the Succubus Who Taught Through Spice\r\n\r\nCaelus and Liora arrive in Hell via a portal, which closes behind them. Caelus is immediately comfortable, prioritizing his cooking knives and salt, while Liora reminds him that in her castle, he is family first, not the Hero. Back in Solphire, Robin and Lingsha feel the separation through the soul bond but quickly transition into their roles, preparing for the day of military coordination. Prince Sunday confirms Caelus and Liora's cover identities, \"Kael and Kela,\" are taking approved leave, and Commander Astraea notes the siblings' unusually refined synchronization, sparking suspicion. Robin and Lingsha brief Sunday and Astraea, confirming Caelus is supporting Liora on a political, not combative, matter in Hell: meeting Lord Azrith of the Shattered Peaks to discuss neutrality terms. They explain Azrith requested Caelus's presence to evaluate his threat level, which Caelus obliviously perceives as a diplomatic courtesy. Robin and Lingsha take over command structure, preparing for Caelus's inevitable guilt upon his return. Meanwhile, in Hell, Liora is immediately occupied by a minor political territorial dispute, leaving Caelus to be \"entertained\" by Sylvia, one of Liora's senior succubi. Sylvia confirms Azrith will arrive the next afternoon. Sylvia then guides Caelus to the kitchen and begins teaching him about courtship strategies using cooking metaphors, which causes Caelus intense mortification but also forces him to recognize that his intentional acts of care and customized cooking are, in fact, expressions of profound devotion, a \"love language\" he had previously categorized as mere \"basic courtesy\" or \"logistics.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 587: The Weight of Scattered Confusion, Unanimous Judgment, and the Love That Required No Category\r\n\r\nLiora and her council endure an eight-hour, tedious negotiation, successfully resolving a minor territorial dispute without escalating the situation. Exhausted, the succubi notice the profound, inviting scent of Caelus's cooking and follow it to the dining hall. Caelus is there, serving a complex, spicy mushroom dish with a spectacular blush, admitting that Sylvia spent the previous eight hours teaching him about \"flirting\" and romantic pursuit using cooking as an explanatory framework, much to the delight of the succubi council. As Liora and the succubi eat the meal, they realize the food carries Caelus's current emotional state: they can taste his scattered confusion, mortification, and the demolition of his comfortable frameworks. However, as the meal progresses, the confusion clears, and the succubi taste his pure, fundamental core\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe uncomplicated love of the six-year-old boy who shared his food without category or justification. Liora, through tears of recognition, confirms that Caelus does not need to be taught how to love but needed to be taught the **vocabulary** and categories to consciously recognize that his instinctual acts of care are **love**, not merely \"meal preparation\" or \"logistics.\" Sylvia defends her intervention, stating that Caelus's obliviousness was a barrier that needed to be dismantled so he could make informed choices about his relationships. Caelus, though mortified, finally accepts the truth: he has been broadcasting his unfiltered inner world through his cooking for years and has been accidentally courting his family through acts of devotion he categorized as mere courtesy. He thanks Sylvia for giving him the necessary vocabulary to understand his own heart, and the chapter concludes with Caelus accepting his exhaustion and falling asleep near the hearth, guarded by Liora, having successfully survived the reconstruction of his worldview.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 588: The Weight of Morning Intimacy, Strategic Affection, and the Preparation for Arrogance\r\n\r\nCaelus wakes in Liora's chamber to find her sleeping impossibly close, her arm draped across his chest. He chooses to stay completely still for thirty minutes, respecting her need for comfort and proximity. When Liora wakes, she calls him \"my heart\" in a moment of unguarded affection. Caelus, intentionally applying Sylvia's lessons on conscious expression, returns the affection by calling her \"my lovely big sister,\" a deliberate counter-move in their ongoing affection game that causes Liora spectacular fluster. Liora stops the game, declaring a new parameter: she will give him her affection completely and freely until they return to Solphire, without reservation or competition, because he is her entire world and she wants him to understand the depth of her love. Caelus responds with pure, unburdened love, confirming his devotion to her transcends status or category. They then join Selene and the succubi council to prepare for Lord Azrith's arrival, which has been delayed until evening. The council determines Azrith's primary motivation is arrogance and pride, which they must manage. Their strategy is singular and limited: **neutrality**, not alliance. Liora plans to humble Azrith not through insult but through a careful demonstration of capability, using herself to establish the demon lord baseline, followed by Caelus demonstrating equivalent or slightly superior power, framed as **support** to Liora. This is intended to convince Azrith that opposing Caelus would be strategically unwise without threatening demonic hierarchy. Caelus recognizes the political manipulation but defers to Liora's expertise, accepting his role as \"proof\" that humanity is capable of contesting godhood, which Liora affirms is the most persuasive argument they have.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 589: The Weight of Calculated Arrogance, Personal Grudges, and the Millisecond That Prevented Annihilation\r\n\r\nLord Azrith arrives at Liora's castle, radiating calculated arrogance and massive capability, reminding Caelus of the deceased Demon Lord Beelzebub. Caelus observes the first phase of the negotiation, which is purely demonic business, confirming Azrith's performance of superiority. Liora initiates the second phase, and Caelus enters the hall, taking a position beside Liora's chair as a physical manifestation of equal partnership. Azrith immediately insults Caelus, calling him a \"pet human,\" but Caelus maintains composure, allowing Liora to manage the verbal sparring. Azrith then recognizes Solareth and confirms Caelus as the human who killed Thanatos, Beelzebub, and Aquila. Caelus confirms this, stating he killed them because they threatened those he had sworn to protect. Azrith escalates the confrontation, mocking Caelus's mortality and demanding he draw Solareth. Caelus deflects the provocation with a cold truth: drawing Solareth in Hell and engaging Valthor would cause the entire layer of Hell to collapse, destroying Azrith's territory indiscriminately. This information forces Azrith to pause and calculate. However, Azrith shatters his control and launches an instantaneous, lethal magical strike at Caelus, fueled by genuine fury. Liora and Sylvia instinctively throw themselves into the attack's path to protect Caelus. In a microsecond of stretched time, Caelus does not draw Solareth fully but moves the blade one millimeter from its sheath. Azrith freezes instantly, realizing Caelus had calculated the exact timing to **behead him** before his attack could reach Liora and Sylvia, demonstrating absolute certainty and commitment to his sister's life over every other consideration, including the preservation of Hell. Azrith withdraws his attack in horror, acknowledging Caelus's devastating capability. Caelus then throws an unexpected verbal provocation, noting Azrith is \"not elegant like the Giant Dullahan.\" Azrith's composure shatters completely, revealing a deep, personal connection and grief for the Dullahan, which he confirms was an honorable friend. Caelus realizes the negotiation is no longer about neutrality but personal vengeance and accounting. Caelus releases Solareth, asking Azrith to sit down, promising to speak truth about the Dullahan's battle and death, acknowledging the need to honor a fallen enemy to salvage the negotiation.\r\n\r\nOf course. Here is a summary of Chapter 590, broken down into its three distinct parts.\r\n\r\n### **Chapter 590 Summary**\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Confrontation**\r\nFollowing a tense standoff in Liora's throne room, Caelus has just revealed to the grieving Demon Lord Azrith that he was the one who killed his best friend, the Giant Dullahan named Dreadnox. Instead of provoking immediate violence, Caelus uses this admission as a starting point for truth. He interrupts Azrith's fury to make a crucial distinction: Azrith is *not* elegant *like* the Dullahan was. This correction confuses Azrith and halts his attack. Seeing the profound grief beneath the rage, Caelus gently asks Azrith to sit so he can recount the full, honorable story of Dreadnox's death. With the entire negotiation hanging in the balance, Azrith, driven by a desperate need to know the truth, reluctantly returns to his chair and commands Caelus to speak.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Recollection of Ocean's Edge**\r\nCaelus delivers a detailed and emotional account of the battle at Ocean's Edge Fortress. He describes being catastrophically outnumbered by a demonic army led by three lords, including Dreadnox. He emphasizes Dreadnox's magnificent warrior spirit and the honor he showed by issuing a formal challenge, separating from the other lords, and fighting Caelus and his squad fairly for hours. Caelus explains how Dreadnox, displeased by the Nightmare Lord's cruel tactics, even allowed them a temporary ceasefire to eliminate that dishonorable foe. The climax of the battle was a final, respectful duel between the two warriors. Caelus, forced to draw his cursed sword Solareth, managed to defeat Dreadnox with a perfect strike. In his final moments, Dreadnox expressed satisfaction, having found the worthy death he had sought for millennia. Caelus concludes by revealing that they built a memorial for Dreadnox at the fortress, honoring him as a warrior of perfect honor.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Weight of Truth and a Path to Peace**\r\nMoved to tears by Caelus's honest and respectful testimony, Azrith's rage transforms into gratitude. He kneels before Caelus, acknowledging that Caelus gave his friend the honorable and fulfilling death he had always wanted. This truth is more valuable to him than vengeance. Azrith declares he will no longer join the war against humanity, pledging strict neutrality to honor Dreadnox's memory and final battle. He agrees to sign a treaty and departs with a newfound respect for Caelus. In the aftermath, an emotionally exhausted Caelus is comforted by his sister Liora and her advisors. The chapter ends with the group resting together on the throne room floor, highlighting that the victory was won not through combat, but through compassion, honest storytelling, and the bonds of family.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 591: The Quiet Weight Beneath Sleeping Wings\r\n\r\nCaelus suddenly fell asleep and was instinctively caught by Liora, who gently rested his head in her lap. His breathing evened out at once, and he began drooling, signaling that the world's demands could not reach him in his sleep. Sylvia and Selene settled close, noting that the Hero looked impossibly small and fragile. They realized he was dreaming of a food festival, evidenced by a small smile, pout, and chomp of air. Liora and the succubi council observed the drool on Liora's dress as proof of his inherent softness and deep trust. Selene and Sylvia expressed profound sorrow, questioning how Liora endures knowing he carries such immense weight while appearing so gentle. Liora confessed that she breaks every day because he shouldn't have to carry his trauma, but she immediately gathers her pieces to rebuild herself, because he needs her whole. She endures because he suffered alone for so long, and she must protect the remnant of his childhood. The three women made a vow to carry him and keep watch over him, confirming they would go to the end of everything for him if he called.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 592: Morning Blossoms in a Demon Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court\r\n\r\nCaelus woke up in Liora's lap in the throne room, with Sylvia and Selene also looking down at him. Before he could utter his customary apology, Liora leaned down and kissed his cheek, a sister's love that silenced his guilt. Sylvia and Selene immediately followed, kissing his other cheek and jaw, completing the affectionate ambush. Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire face instantly turned a catastrophic tomato-red. He stammered a \"good morning\" before fleeing the room to the kitchen to cook. The familiar rhythm of cooking\u00e2\u20ac\u201dchopping, stirring, tasting\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcooled his embarrassment. He cooked a feast for everyone who assisted with the negotiations, motivated by gratitude. Carrying the trays, Caelus gathered his courage and sincerely told the three dozen waiting succubi: \"Thank you... for your help yesterday. Truly. I... I love you all. Really.\" The entire hall of succubi melted into chaos, with surprised whimpers and fainting. Liora stepped behind him, resting a hand on his shoulder, and whispered that what he said was \"perfect,\" confirming that he had successfully chosen love and gratitude over apology. Caelus still didn't fully understand the emotional devastation he caused, but he felt the warmth of their answer, which was enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Chapter 593: The Weight of Farewells, Maid Uniforms, and the Politics That Defied Imitation\r\nCaelus, the Hero, delivers a deeply personal and specific farewell to the thirty-seven succubi who helped with the negotiations, remembering each of their names and contributions. His genuine sincerity moves the succubi to bow to him, a gesture reserved for demon royalty. Liora, Sylvia, and Selene then escort him back to Solphire's castle via a portal. Sylvia and Selene appear in immaculate maid uniforms, their cover story to serve as Liora's new attendants and security. They join Robin, Lingsha, and Sunday, who are waiting in the garden. Robin immediately pins an embarrassed Caelus to her shoulder for comfort. Liora reports that Caelus secured Lord Azrith's neutrality, removing 18,000 combat-capable demons from Valthor's forces purely through honesty and respect. Sunday acknowledges that Caelus's sincerity is a terrifyingly effective, inimitable political weapon.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Chapter 594: The Weight of Enforced Rest, Childhood Defiance, and the Alliance That Rewrote the War\r\nRobin and Lingsha forcibly drag a protesting Caelus away from tactical planning to enforce mandatory rest, treating him like a petulant child who refuses basic care, which Liora explains is a coping mechanism from a lifetime of learned vulnerability. The demon lords and Sunday discuss the strategic impact of Caelus's accomplishments. Azrith's neutrality is significant, as he is one of the Seven Old Lords and commands 18,000 elite demons, greatly improving humanity's survival odds. They confirm that Caelus has, without violence, neutralized or secured three strategically valuable demon lord factions (Liora's, Kronos's, and Azrith's), removing over 23,000 demons from Valthor's potential army before the war has even begun. They conclude that Caelus's sincerity is both his greatest weapon and vulnerability, necessitating the others' protective intervention.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Chapter 595: The Weight of Obsession, Golden Fury, and the Man Who Refused Lesser Goals\r\nSunday, Sylvia, and Selene observe a training session where Commander William of Squad Ironshrine spars against Commander Astraea, who is operating at four-stack enhancement (a minor demon lord level). William, unenhanced but driven by the grief of losing his family to Valthor's presence, matches Astraea's superhuman speed and power through flawless technique and prediction\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhaving spent eight years training to counter divine combat patterns. William loses but uses the spar to map Astraea's weaknesses, refusing to accept any goal smaller than killing Valthor personally. Sunday realizes Ironshrine is training to an impossible standard, making them a living proof-of-concept for the doctrine's potential and a strategic multiplier for the entire human force.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Chapter 596 (Revised): The Weight of Pinned Protests, Biological Necessities, and the Fear That Never Truly Fades\r\nLiora finds Robin effectively pinning Caelus to the bed with her full body weight to enforce rest, while Lingsha writes a letter to Celestine mentioning the comfort of the Caelus doll during his absence. Caelus's rest is interrupted when he admits he needs to use the bathroom, causing Robin extreme mortification as she realizes she nearly caused a \"diplomatic incident\" by overlooking biological necessities. The lightheartedness fades as Robin admits to Liora her profound fear and trauma from watching Caelus die twice (during Kronos's trial and at Lumora). Liora comforts Robin, sharing her own fear and acknowledging that their protectiveness is a response to the trauma. Caelus returns and apologizes for making them worry, and they reaffirm their commitment to support and protect him, accepting that the fear may never fade.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Chapter 597: The Weight of Selection Day, Perfect Blessings, and the Storm Before Engagement\r\nThe training ground is set for Selection Day to determine which squad will challenge Caelus at ten percent of Valthor's capability. Caelus, Robin (who is draped possessively on his shoulder), Liora, and Sunday are on the command platform. Below, Lingsha and her priestesses efficiently apply four-stack enhancement to Elite Squad Seven using Lingsha's documented, teachable methodology, which democratizes the capability. Sunday and Liora discuss the impressive efficiency and resilience the doctrine now has. The first match is announced: Elite Squad Seven versus Squad Flame Wings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Chapter 598: The Weight of Opening Violence, Calculated Chaos, and the Moment Before Collapse\r\nSquad Flame Wings initiates the match with a massive, explosive surge of calculated violence, using pre-positioned magical traps to disrupt Elite Squad Seven's formation, forcing them onto the defensive. Elite Squad Seven is forced to adapt, utilizing their \"Scatter Protocol,\" but the pressure is intense. Astraea intervenes, providing an anchor for tactical consolidation without using her innate blessing. As Flame Wings attempts a final, desperate surge, Astraea activates her four-stack equivalent innate blessing, overwhelming their exhausted reserves through sheer superior, sustainable power. Flame Wings is defeated, proving that Elite Squad Seven's endurance and technical perfection can outlast even the most aggressive, explosive strategies. Elite Squad Seven earns the right to challenge Caelus at ten percent capability in two days.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Chapter 599: The Weight of Final Selection, Quiet Encouragement, and the Storm That Waited for Permission\r\nDuring the break, Caelus and Robin visit the medical bay to check on the exhausted soldiers. Caelus offers gentle, specific encouragement to Elite Squad Seven, validating their tactical sacrifice. He also reassures the defeated Squad Flame Wings that their loss was due to specialization against a bad matchup, not inadequacy, boosting their morale. Robin notes his talent for rebuilding confidence. The final match is announced: Squad Ironshrine versus Enhanced Squad.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Chapter 600: The Weight of Mirrored Divinity, Systematic Excellence, and the Adaptation That Shattered Stone\r\nThe final match between Squad Ironshrine and Enhanced Squad detonates with terrifying force. Ironshrine, led by William, moves with an adaptive instinct mirroring Caelus's divine combat patterns, overwhelming Enhanced Squad's systematic excellence. Commander Gareth counters with layered tactical traps, forcing Ironshrine onto the defensive. In response, William deliberately exceeds safe parameters by forcing an unauthorized five-stack enhancement, severely damaging his body to shatter Gareth's trap sequence with overwhelming force. As William's body begins to fail, Gareth sacrifices himself to create a fractional opening, allowing Enhanced Squad to reform and defeat the collapsing William. Enhanced Squad wins, but the match proves that human capability can contest the impossible through either systematic excellence or a terrifying, adaptive will to destroy oneself for victory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Chapter 601: The Weight of Tomorrow's Storm, Public Declarations, and the Request That Sounded Like a Vow\r\nSunday formally announces the ten percent challenge will take place at a specific external site due to the immense environmental impact of that capability level (sufficient to generate a majestic aurora visible across three continents). He enforces a two-kilometer safety perimeter for all observers. Robin quietly tells Caelus she will be present for the entire engagement because she needs to be there\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto share the burden and to avoid watching him die from a distance again, acknowledging the trauma of Lumora and Kronos's trial. Caelus, in a moment of sincere vulnerability, tells her he's glad she'll be there, and formally asks her to \"Please work with me. Please guide me, as you always do.\" Robin and Liora recognize the statement's profound romantic weight, as it acknowledges his need for her anchor at the pinnacle. Robin vows to guide him always, confirming that he won't stand alone anymore.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 602: The Weight of Blunted Edges, Unified Calculation, and the Promise That Shaped Tomorrow\r\n\r\n* **The Walk and Shared Anxiety:** Caelus and Robin walk together after Selection Day. Through their soul bond, Caelus feels Robin's anxiety stemming from the trauma of watching him die during Kronos's trial and falling through dimensions to catch his corpse.\r\n* **Robin's Vow:** Robin tells Caelus that when he uses the unified capability tomorrow, he won't be carrying the burden alone; she will be integrated with him, sharing the weight, feeling everything he feels, and moving as he moves. Caelus thanks her, having learned that apologizing for the shared burden only hurts her more.\r\n* **The Command Tent Briefing:** In the command tent, Liora leads a tactical briefing. Astraea reports that William from the Enhanced Squad is severely injured from forcing a five-stack enhancement to break Gareth's defensive formation. Robin notes that William's action proves the doctrine works, but Caelus feels guilt over the suffering his standards impose.\r\n* **Engagement Parameters and Injury Probability:** Liora confirms the challenge site and that the Enhanced Squad (now seven members led by Gareth) will receive four-stack enhancement. The probability of severe injury is estimated at 43%, and critical, life-threatening injury at 11%, assuming Caelus operates at 10% capability. Temporal Reversal is authorized only for death prevention.\r\n* **Caelus's Requested Modifications (The Start):** Caelus requests to start the engagement at five percent capability, not ten percent, and then escalate gradually (to seven, then ten percent) to give the soldiers a chance to adapt and learn rather than be immediately overwhelmed. The commanders agree this is a valuable teaching methodology.\r\n* **Caelus's Requested Modifications (The Wings):** Caelus states that at ten percent capability, his divine wings are weapons of mass lethality (once slicing a demon lord into three pieces). To prevent accidental death, he requests to modify the wing configuration to blunt, rounded shields, reducing the lethality risk to blunt force trauma instead of lacerations. Liora approves the blunted wing configuration.\r\n* **The Unified Capability:** Liora discusses the unified capability: Robin will remain in Caelus's arms, serving as the primary offensive asset while Caelus focuses on defensive maneuvering and safety monitoring. Caelus explains this delegation allows him to focus entirely on ensuring no one dies. Liora warns Caelus that if his Solareth curse triggers while unified, Robin will experience the death visions with him, and Caelus must end the engagement immediately. Robin affirms her acceptance of the risk, insisting they will face it together.\r\n* **Final Moment of Peace:** The final parameters are set: engagement at dawn, 5% baseline, blunted wings, unified capability active. Caelus asks Robin, Lingsha, and Liora to stay with him overnight, and they agree, choosing to face the day together.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 603: The Weight of Dawn Preparation, Scattered Grass, and the Breath Before Thunder\r\n\r\n* **Commander Preparation:** At the training site, Commanders Astraea and Gareth conduct final terrain assessments with their soldiers, Elite Squad Seven and Enhanced Squad. William, despite his injuries, participates and analyzes potential tactical advantages. Astraea acknowledges that Caelus will hurt the soldiers but will carry every injury as a personal failure, while the soldiers are choosing this risk for the hope he represents.\r\n* **Soldier Anticipation:** Three thousand soldiers gather on the observation platform, their atmosphere electric with anticipation. They discuss the potential for the enhanced soldiers to land a hit and the difficulty of contesting the exponential power of ten percent capability, concluding that the engagement is about learning their limits and contesting the impossible. Prince Aldric arrives from Valcrest to witness the event.\r\n* **Sunday and Aldric on Robin:** Sunday tells Aldric that Robin's decision to integrate with Caelus is both tactically brilliant and emotionally devastating, as she will feel his guilt and the soldiers' pain through the soul bond. He confirms Robin is both the strongest and most devoted person he knows, choosing to make shared vulnerability her armor.\r\n* **Priestess Corps Preparation:** Lingsha gathers her twelve priestesses to review the four-stack enhancement application sequence and critical injury response protocols. She reassures a younger priestess that their methodology is systematic and reproducible, and she will correct any error to prevent backlash.\r\n* **Lingsha and Mira's Concern:** Lingsha reflects on the pain Caelus will feel when he hurts the soldiers he is trying to protect, and Sister Mira comforts her, noting that Caelus's capacity for shared pain is why people trust him.\r\n* **Caelus and Robin's Quiet Moment:** Caelus and Robin lie in the grass, hidden from view. Caelus expresses his fear of miscalculation and causing a soldier's death. Robin asserts that they will use Temporal Reversal if necessary and that he is not alone; she will be there to pull him back if the guilt overwhelms him. Caelus is able to find a moment of rest by focusing on the earth supporting him.\r\n* **The Start:** As the sun rises, the preparations are complete. Robin tells Caelus it is time. Caelus admits he will never be ready for this, but they might as well begin. They walk toward the center of the basin, ready to start the engagement together.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 604: The Weight of Divine Unveiling, Prayer-Imbued Intimacy, and the Presence That Stopped Breath\r\n\r\n* **Final Call to Action:** The basin is silent as the fourteen enhanced soldiers stand in formation. Caelus confirms Lingsha and the medical team are ready, then addresses the soldiers, emphasizing that their goal is learning and measuring their limits, not defeating him.\r\n* **The Transformation:** Caelus closes his eyes, and the transformation to his divine form begins without fanfare. Golden light erupts from his core, spreading vast, magnificent spirit wings behind him, and a complex halo crystallizes above his head. His eyes blaze with golden fire, and the entire basin shudders from his overwhelming presence at just five percent capability. Soldiers instinctively drop to one knee, and observers are struck by the form's terrifying beauty.\r\n* **The Unified Activation:** Caelus lifts Robin into a perfect princess carry. Robin's arms wrap around his neck, anchoring him. They share a soft, intentional kiss, and Robin silently prays to the Goddess Solara, asking for the soldiers' safety and for the ability to carry Caelus's pain, so he doesn't have to stand alone anymore.\r\n* **The Halo's Descent:** The halo above Caelus's head descends, settling onto Robin's head in response to her prayer. Power floods Robin's core, instantly unifying her awareness with Caelus's. She feels his love, mortification, and relief, and Caelus feels her determined love and her prayer to share his burden.\r\n* **Mortification and Awe:** They break the kiss, and Caelus is overwhelmed with mortification, realizing three thousand people just watched him kiss Robin while in his divine form. Robin gently teases him, noting his embarrassment proves he is still human. On the observation platform, Sunday accepts Robin's choice to be bound to Caelus, and Aldric describes the moment as the look of love refusing to accept distance.\r\n* **Divine Restructuring:** Caelus's divine wings spread, then deliberately change configuration. The razor-sharp edges blunt, transforming the wings from weapons of mass lethality into solid, rounded shields, fulfilling the safety modification. Gareth notes that Caelus is prioritizing safety over combat effectiveness. Soldiers are openly weeping, seeing a being of godlike power deliberately choose kindness.\r\n* **Engagement Begins:** Caelus and Robin, now a unified entity at five percent capability, move with impossible speed to a position twenty meters from the formation. Caelus confirms, \"We begin.\" The unified form sweeps its blunted wings forward, applying pressure as the engagement starts.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 605: The Weight of Unified Onslaught, Impossible Adaptation, and the Strike That Cost Everything\r\n\r\n* **Unified Onslaught:** The soldiers, prepared for Caelus as a swordsman, are instead met by Robin's magic. With Caelus's unlimited power, Robin instantly creates massive ice spears, forcing the formation to scatter. She follows up with a perfectly orchestrated sequence of twelve fire spheres, surgically controlling the battlefield and forcing the soldiers into defensive positions, proving they cannot hide or defend indefinitely.\r\n* **Tactical Delegation:** Caelus, operating with his full awareness delegated to safety monitoring, observes Robin's perfect positioning and timing, noting that she is overwhelming them with tactical precision, not just raw power. Robin utilizes advanced techniques, combining spatial anchors and elemental magic to create zones of altered physics, trapping three soldiers and forcing Astraea to abandon a rescue attempt.\r\n* **Caelus Applies Pressure:** Caelus, with his reaction time effectively doubled due to the unified configuration, applies pressure with his blunted wings, pushing the soldiers. William attempts to exploit an exposed flank but is instantly intercepted by Caelus's folded wing, suffering a brutal, though non-lethal, collision. Gareth realizes they are fighting a single consciousness operating two bodies, optimized for offense (Robin) and defense/positioning (Caelus).\r\n* **Soldier Adaptation:** Astraea, recognizing the dual-body consciousness, implements Protocol Serpent, a trap designed to split Caelus's attention. Enhanced Squad feigns collapse, luring Robin's fire spheres into a clustered area to be dispersed, while Elite Squad Seven closes the distance to exploit the momentary distraction.\r\n* **Astraea's Clean Hit:** Caelus defends by deploying his blunted wings to slow Elite Seven. Astraea, having studied his defensive reflexes, uses her enhanced speed and innate blessing to match the frequency of his divine capability. She slips past the barriers and lands a visible strike on Caelus's divine armor. The armor holds, but the visible impact proves that godhood can be touched.\r\n* **Lesson Learned and Escalation Postponed:** The observation platform erupts in applause; the soldiers confirm the doctrine is valid, and the impossible is reachable. Astraea explains her success was due to exploiting the fractional moment Caelus's defensive priority shifted. Caelus is filled with pride and relief, understanding the soldiers learned the key lesson: contesting godhood requires superior tactical awareness and precise execution, not matching power. Caelus postpones escalation, allowing the soldiers to consolidate the lesson. The engagement continues, with Astraea commanding the soldiers to find a way to make Caelus acknowledge all of them.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 606: The Weight of Silent Conspiracy, Calculated Sacrifice, and the Strike That Shattered Heaven\r\n\r\n* **The Pause and Realization:** After thirty minutes of engagement, Caelus and Robin note the soldiers are learning and decide to let them regroup before escalating pressure. The battlefield is devastated, but the soldiers are renewed after Astraea's clean hit.\r\n* **The Silent Conspiracy:** While Caelus focuses on safety, commanders William, Astraea, and Gareth communicate a complex attack plan using subtle, invisible hand signals.\r\n* **The Calculated Sacrifice:** William requests Astraea's powerful innate blessing to execute the strike. Astraea agrees immediately, sacrificing her own capability to give William eight-stack equivalent enhancement\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe highest ever carried by a human outside of Caelus's Solareth.\r\n* **The Perfect Distraction:** The soldiers execute the plan: Enhanced Squad charges to draw Robin's offensive attention, Elite Squad Seven scatters to divide Caelus's defensive focus, and Astraea charges recklessly to force Caelus to narrow his attention to her safety.\r\n* **The Disruptive Strike:** William exploits the microsecond of divided attention, using his eight-stack enhancement to strike the focal point of Caelus's divine transformation.\r\n* **The Result and Reduction:** The strike fractures the divine form, reducing Caelus and Robin's unified capability from ten percent to five percent baseline. Robin realizes Caelus alone is now at three percent.\r\n* **The New Doctrine:** The watching soldiers, including Sunday, realize William proved that godhood can be systematically contested and reduced through coordinated human capability.\r\n* **The Cost and Acknowledgment:** William's body is severely injured from maintaining the eight-stack enhancement, but he achieved his goal. Caelus acknowledges the successful strike and decides not to restore full power, letting the soldiers absorb the lesson of capability reduction.\r\n* **The New Challenge:** Caelus announces they are now at five percent baseline and challenges the remaining soldiers to replicate William's success. The engagement continues, now focused on proving the doctrine is repeatable.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 607: The Weight of Unleashed Joy, Falling Stars, and the Grin That Promised Thunder\r\n\r\n* **Caelus's Shift in Joy:** Caelus is no longer afraid to hurt the soldiers, realizing they are more resilient than he thought. He smiles with pure, unguarded delight and decides to stop holding back, trusting them to survive his full attention.\r\n* **The Ascent and Preparation:** Caelus launches skyward with impossible acceleration, reaching an altitude where the air itself shimmers. He uses this distance to safely rebuild their unified capability to the full ten percent.\r\n* **The Storm's Birth:** Electrical discharges spread from Caelus's position, causing the sky to darken and thunder to roll as the atmosphere responds to the massive energy concentration. The air becomes heavy with charge.\r\n* **Ten Percent Restoration:** The lightning converges in a brilliant flash, and Caelus's divine form blazes with terrifying intensity. He has successfully rebuilt the ten percent unified capability, with the surrounding storm clouds being the atmospheric response to containing the power.\r\n* **The Meteor's Descent:** Astraea orders the soldiers to brace for impact. Caelus's divine form, trailing fire, falls toward the basin like a golden meteor at terminal velocity.\r\n* **The Kinetic Impact:** Caelus and Robin strike the ground with the force of a natural disaster, creating a thirty-meter-wide, five-meter-deep crater and generating a massive shockwave that rearranges the terrain.\r\n* **The Lesson of Magnitude:** The devastating impact proves the true, physical, reality-warping power of ten percent unified capability. Sunday and Aldric realize the soldiers now understand the magnitude of the challenge they are training to contest.\r\n* **The Unrepentant Grin:** Caelus emerges from the crater's center, unharmed and grinning with pure, unadulterated joy. Robin notes he's having the time of his life, which reassures her that the power hasn't changed his fundamental nature.\r\n* **Astraea's Challenge:** Astraea emerges, equally delighted and unbowed, and taunts Caelus to come down and face them properly, proving that despite the impossible power, she still sees him as Caelus, her friend and challenge. The engagement continues.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 608: The Weight of Final Breath, Amplified Devastation, and the Hand That Struck Heaven\r\n\r\n* **Focus Technique:** Facing ten percent unified capability, Astraea authorizes the \"Focus\" technique\u00e2\u20ac\u201da physiological override allowing the exhausted soldiers a one-to-two-hour window of peak performance at the cost of catastrophic collapse afterward.\r\n* **Ten Percent Onslaught:** Robin unleashes magic on a new scale: ice walls thirty meters wide, a persistent river of fire, and overlapping fields of spatial distortion, creating comprehensive battlefield control. Caelus actively directs the attacks based on real-time safety and tactical assessment.\r\n* **The Impossible Gap:** The unified capability at ten percent is exponentially effective, countering every conventional attack and innovation the soldiers attempt. For thirty minutes, the soldiers, despite using Focus, land zero hits, proving the gap is too vast for conventional methodology.\r\n* **Caelus Prepares to End:** Caelus, recognizing the psychological toll, decides to end the engagement before it leads to despair.\r\n* **Astraea's Final Strike:** As Caelus begins to call the conclusion, Astraea, who had been systematically retreating and positioning herself, strikes him from his blind spot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe back of his head\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith her bare, non-threatening hand.\r\n* **Outsmarting Godhood:** The strike makes perfect contact, bypassing all defensive protocols because it didn't register as a combat threat. Astraea had contested Caelus's awareness, not his power, proving that patient, non-threatening positioning could exploit the blind spots created by a consciousness focused on combat.\r\n* **The Acknowledgment and Collapse:** Caelus, thoroughly embarrassed but deeply admiring, dissolves his divine form, formally confirming Astraea's strike. William and the other soldiers immediately collapse as the Focus technique fails, the deferred exhaustion hitting their systems all at once.\r\n* **The Victory of Innovation:** Caelus confirms three total hits landed in the engagement, all by different methods, proving that godhood can be contested through skill, coordination, and tactical innovation rather than raw power. The soldiers share a moment of hope, realizing they have a path to contesting demon lords.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 609: The Weight of Falling Bodies, Growling Dignity, and the Meal That Welcomed Heroes Home\r\n\r\n* **The Focus Crash:** The moment Caelus concludes the engagement, the Focus technique fails, and the fourteen enhanced soldiers collapse in near-perfect synchronization from catastrophic, deferred exhaustion.\r\n* **Medical Response and Honor:** Lingsha and the priestess corps immediately deploy for medical treatment. Three thousand observing soldiers pour into the basin, not to thank Caelus, but to honor and carefully carry the collapsed fighters to the medical tents with reverence, acknowledging them as the true heroes.\r\n* **Caelus's Growling Dignity:** In the midst of the solemn atmosphere, Caelus's stomach growls loudly and repeatedly due to his catastrophic caloric expenditure, causing startled laughter and immense embarrassment for Caelus.\r\n* **The Intervention:** Liora, Lingsha, and Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith Liora as the lead\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgently but firmly override Caelus's protests and attempts to prioritize others. They tell him his exhaustion requires immediate food.\r\n* **The Prepared Meal:** They drag him toward the observation area where Liora and Lingsha had conspired with Mother Serra (the noodle stall owner) to set up a massive field kitchen and prepare a special, private meal specifically for Caelus.\r\n* **The Surrender to Care:** Caelus realizes they arranged the entire support network to ensure his self-care. Liora threatens him with extremely embarrassing \"airplane noises\" if he argues or apologizes, forcing his surrender. He accepts the care, recognizing that accepting love is a form of strength.\r\n* **The Homecoming:** Caelus sits down to eat, surrounded by family who had planned elaborate schemes to ensure his well-being, finally allowing himself to be cared for after pushing himself far beyond his limits.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 610: The Weight of Sunset Permission, Wife Wisdom, and the Rest That Required Surrender\r\n\r\n* **Fighting Sleep:** After eating the restorative meal, Caelus fights a losing battle against overwhelming exhaustion, his mind sluggish and his body demanding immediate unconsciousness. He tries to argue that he must check on the soldiers and prepare tactical reports.\r\n* **Wife Wisdom:** Prince Aldric, Princess Elara (Mother Serra's daughter), and Sunday intervene. Elara delivers the final, decisive argument: resting isn't about his recovery, but about making his family happy by accepting the care they've offered. She dismantles his self-destructive nobility.\r\n* **The Final Surrender:** Caelus realizes that resting honors their love and trust. He accepts their judgment, choosing to surrender to care rather than fight a battle that would only hurt the people who love him.\r\n* **Sunday's Coordination:** Sunday confirms he has already coordinated the medical follow-up, engagement documentation, and the training schedule suspension for the week, removing Caelus's remaining excuses. He threatens to have guards physically restrain Caelus if he tries to check on soldiers during the night.\r\n* **Journey Home:** Caelus, supported by Robin, Lingsha, and Liora, is guided to the waiting carriage. He gives his final, sincere thanks to his family for planning his care and not letting him destroy himself.\r\n* **Deep Sleep:** Within moments of settling into the carriage's modified, comfortable interior, Caelus falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, his body finally relaxed as his mind surrenders to exhaustion. His family begins the peaceful journey home, sharing the weight of the day.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 611: The Weight of Homecoming, Parental Blessing, and the Chest That Became Sanctuary\r\n\r\n* **The Drooling Hero:** Caelus sleeps deeply in the carriage, eventually settling his head on Robin's shoulder and unconsciously drooling on her, a fact Robin and the others observe with profound affection and amusement.\r\n* **Royal Welcome:** Upon arriving at the castle, King Aldric and Queen Seraphina are waiting to personally welcome them home, confirming they have prepared Caelus's chamber and set up explicit security protocols to ensure he is not disturbed.\r\n* **Prioritizing Love:** The King and Queen confirm the engagement's success and zero critical casualties. Queen Seraphina then explicitly forbids Robin from engaging in documentation or strategic analysis tomorrow, telling her Sunday will handle it. She grants Robin permission to prioritize taking care of Caelus, stating, \"Just take care of him. Anything else is secondary.\"\r\n* **Preparation for Rest:** Robin, Lingsha, and Liora carefully maneuver the unconscious Caelus to his chamber, change him into soft sleepwear, and make him comfortable.\r\n* **Claiming Sanctuary:** Robin claims her preferred sleeping position, settling atop Caelus's chest with her ear over his heart. Lingsha and Liora take the left and right sides, completing their protective formation.\r\n* **Shared Peace:** The three women fall asleep, anchored by Caelus's steady presence, their hands connecting across his sleeping form. They finally surrender to their own exhaustion, resting in the peace of a sanctuary created by shared love and devotion, knowing that tomorrow's strength is built on tonight's surrender to care.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 612: The Weight of Documentation, Political Concern, and the Love That Moved Goddesses\r\n\r\n* **The Council Meeting Begins:** Prince Sunday presents a comprehensive report on the training engagement to delegates from allied kingdoms, city-states, and territories.\r\n* **Success and Strategy:** Sunday confirms the program exceeded projections, validated the doctrine, and proved that human coordination can contest divine threats, emphasizing that humanity's survival is no longer dependent on Caelus alone.\r\n* **Political Concerns Raised:** A delegate, Lord Marvin, expresses concern about the political and diplomatic risk of Princess Robin, an heir, being in direct combat.\r\n* **Intimacy Protocol Questioned:** Another delegate, Lady Cassandra, asks if the unified capability (ten percent divine power) can be activated without the \"kissing protocol\" due to concerns about the intimate nature of the combat activation.\r\n* **Sister Mira's Intervention:** Sister Mira, the priestess representing Lumora's temple, steps in to explain the divine mechanics, asserting that the capability is not a tactical protocol.\r\n* **Divine Requirement is Love:** Sister Mira states that the kiss is merely a variable; the unified capability requires genuine prayer, sincerity, and profound devotion\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kind of love recognized and amplified by Goddess Solara, a goddess of love.\r\n* **Political Concerns Moot:** Sister Mira asserts that any attempt to manufacture the activation through political arrangement will fail, making political concerns about the relationship irrelevant compared to the spiritual necessity.\r\n* **Strategic Asset Confirmed:** The delegates conclude that the relationship between Caelus and Robin is a spiritual asset to be protected and honored, as it is essential for humanity's ability to contest demon lord threats.\r\n* **The Council Accepts Divine Logic:** Sunday formally confirms that Robin's involvement is a strategic necessity validated by divine authority, and the delegates shift from political questioning to profound respect, realizing the love between Caelus and Robin is a miracle.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 613: The Weight of Twenty Strikes, Fallen Chairs, and the Theory That Rewrote Destiny\r\n\r\n* **William's Tactical Analysis:** Sister Mira relays tactical intelligence from Commander William, a former priest and Valthor survivor, who detailed the successful reduction of Caelus's divine capability.\r\n* **Eight-Stack Concentration:** William's strike used four innate blessing stacks plus four transferred from Astraea, concentrated into his weapon and aimed precisely at the structural focal point of Caelus's divine form, achieving a five percent capability reduction.\r\n* **The Theory is Introduced:** William hypothesizes that if humanity could coordinate twenty separate strikes using his eight-stack concentration technique against Demon King Valthor, the Demon King's divine manifestation could be reduced by one hundred percent.\r\n* **Shock and Disbelief:** The theory\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat twenty coordinated human strikes could systematically strip Valthor of his godhood\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcauses absolute silence, which is broken by Prince Sunday physically falling out of his chair in shock.\r\n* **Implications of the Breakthrough:** The delegates quickly realize this is a genuine breakthrough, transforming the goal from merely delaying Valthor to systematically dismantling his divine capability until he becomes a contestable force.\r\n* **Strategic Shift:** Sunday confirms the training program's focus must shift to systematically dismantling Valthor's divine capability through coordinated human effort.\r\n* **Limitations and Possibility:** Princess Seraphine notes the significant limitations (specialized candidates, immediate soldier collapse, high risk) but Prince Aldric counters that possibility, however difficult, is better than certain extinction.\r\n* **Grief Transformed to Methodology:** Sister Mira emphasizes that this path to victory was born from William's human determination, tactical innovation, and refusal to accept that godhood was untouchable.\r\n* **Foundation for Victory:** The council accepts William's theory as the foundation for all future planning, recognizing that human achievement, driven by one man's grief, might save the entire species.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 614: The Weight of Thirteen Months, Organized Chaos, and the Clock That Counted Down to Everything\r\n\r\n* **Organized Chaos:** The council chamber erupts into purposeful chaos as delegates begin immediate planning to implement William's theory, sketching resource allocation and selection criteria for a hundred candidates.\r\n* **Resource Commitment:** Allied kingdoms, led by Valcrest and Ashenvale, immediately commit all available resources (military, financial, medical, and religious infrastructure) to the anti-Valthor doctrine implementation.\r\n* **Three-Phase Development:** Sunday mandates a three-phase development plan: two months for candidate identification, four months for intensive training under William, and the remaining time for full integration and coordination drills.\r\n* **The Remaining Time:** Princess Seraphine forces the question of remaining time, and Sunday confirms that eleven months have passed since Valthor's declaration, leaving **thirteen months** (395 days) until the final invasion window closes.\r\n* **Accepting the Impossible Timeline:** The number settles across the chamber, and Sister Mira cuts through the despair, declaring that thirteen months is sufficient time to *attempt* the impossible, and that failure to attempt the plan guarantees extinction.\r\n* **Unified Commitment:** Delegation after delegation stands to commit unconditionally, abandoning centuries of self-interest in favor of unified species survival.\r\n* **Final Mandate:** Sunday concludes the meeting, stating that the cost will be catastrophic and success is barely probable, but they commit fully to the thirteen months of brutal preparation to ensure the soldiers' sacrifice purchases humanity's survival.\r\n* **The Clock is Counting Down:** The delegates depart for their territories to begin the immediate implementation, leaving Sunday alone to process the fact that humanity now has a desperate, brutal plan to contest the inevitable, with the clock running.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 615: The Weight of House Arrest, Stolen Stories, and the Lap That Held Heaven\r\n\r\nThe chapter opens with Caelus under a loving form of house arrest in his chamber for two days, an order enforced by Liora, Robin, and Lingsha to ensure he rests after a strenuous training exercise. He is lying on the balcony with his head in Liora's lap, who gently scolds him for thinking about his duties and soldiers, insisting his only task is to accept their care. Lingsha feeds him apples she picked at dawn, emphasizing their desire to take care of him in return for his constant care of them. To his left, Robin reads aloud a simple, dramatic fairy tale about a hero and a princess who loves him for who he is. The story profoundly moves all of them, and Caelus realizes it is a sincere, unguarded declaration of love and promise from Robin. The chapter concludes with Caelus feeling the warm, undeniable weight of their love and finally allowing himself to believe that he might be worthy of a \"happily ever after.\"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Chapter 616: The Weight of Fabric Warfare, Borrowed Ignorance, and the Tomato Who Spoke Truth\r\n\r\nCaelus is caught in a \"fabric warfare\" as Robin and Lingsha try on various elegant dresses for a planned outing, with Liora acting as a meticulous fashion consultant. Caelus attempts to hide his extreme embarrassment and blushes by pretending to read an advanced magic textbook he doesn't understand. When forced to give his opinion, his commentary is either strategically vague, calling a beautiful sapphire dress \"very... blue,\" or profoundly honest, calling Lingsha \"beautiful\" and Robin, in a gold dress, \"like the sun.\" Liora ultimately selects the two women's final outfits. Caelus learns the entire dress competition was a ruse; it was a setup to take him out for a normal, simple evening walk, and they had a new, tailored outfit ready for him. Touched by their planning and affection, Caelus accepts, agreeing to their rule of not talking about training once.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Chapter 617: The Weight of Maternal Blessing, Wandering Questions, and the Date That Had a Plan\r\n\r\nRobin, Lingsha, and Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe latter still oblivious to the true nature of the event\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhead out of the castle. They immediately run into Prince Sunday and Commander Helena, who exchange knowing glances and confirm that Caelus is on a \"date,\" while Caelus insists it's \"just a walk.\" They wish him well, joking about his propensity to talk about ingredients and tactical briefings. The trio then encounters King Aldric and Queen Seraphina, who give them a warm, maternal blessing and an order to \"Be young. Be happy.\" The Queen's gesture of holding the King's hand mirrors how the two women are holding Caelus, a parallel not lost on anyone. The King adds an affectionate warning not to let Caelus analyze \"market efficiency.\"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Chapter 618: The Weight of Evening Light, Unscripted Laughter, and the Date That Ignored the Plan\r\n\r\nRobin's meticulously planned date is immediately derailed by Caelus's inability to ignore someone in need. First, he stops to help an elderly market vendor carry a heavy basket of produce, walking five blocks off-route. During this time, Robin corrects Caelus when he calls them his \"friends\" by stating they are his \"Girlfriends,\" making him blush furiously. Next, he rescues a cat named Mr. Whiskers stuck on a window ledge, which he scales with combat efficiency, drawing an appreciative crowd and more embarrassment. Finally, he stops to repair a street musician's broken lute string, earning a spontaneous romantic serenade.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reach the cafe, Caelus is mortified, thinking he ruined the plan. Robin assures him he made it better, explaining the plan was for him to be happy, and his kindness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis inability to walk past someone who needs help\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis the very reason she loves him.\r\n\r\nThe evening continues with a game: Robin and Lingsha split up and hide in the city, challenging Caelus to find them using only his knowledge of their personalities. Liora joins Caelus and interprets his tactical analysis for finding them first\u00e2\u20ac\u201dchoosing Lingsha based on her emotional personality profile\u00e2\u20ac\u201das a profoundly romantic demonstration of understanding their hearts. Caelus then decides on his own next step: he must first acquire a gift. The chapter concludes with Caelus and Liora entering a bakery for a \"tactical dessert acquisition\" of honey cakes, a demonstration of his perfect understanding of what they would like.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 615: The Weight of House Arrest, Stolen Stories, and the Lap That Held Heaven\r\n\r\nCaelus is held under a loving form of house arrest for two days by Liora, Robin, and Lingsha to ensure he rests after intense training. He lies on the balcony with his head in Liora's lap, while Lingsha feeds him apples. Robin reads a fairy tale aloud about a hero and a princess, which Caelus recognizes as a sincere declaration of love and a promise from her. He feels the profound weight of their affection and finally accepts that he might be worthy of a \"happily ever after.\"\r\n\r\n## Chapter 616: The Weight of Fabric Warfare, Borrowed Ignorance, and the Tomato Who Spoke Truth\r\n\r\nCaelus is forced into a \"fabric warfare\" as Robin and Lingsha try on various dresses, with Liora acting as a consultant. He tries to hide his embarrassment by pretending to read an advanced magic textbook. When asked for his opinion, he gives vague comments or extremely honest ones, such as calling Lingsha beautiful and Robin, in a gold dress, \"like the sun.\" Caelus later discovers the dress competition was a ruse to take him out for a simple evening walk, and they had a new, tailored outfit ready for him.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 617: The Weight of Maternal Blessing, Wandering Questions, and the Date That Had a Plan\r\n\r\nCaelus, Robin, and Lingsha leave the castle for their outing. They immediately run into Prince Sunday and Commander Helena, who exchange knowing glances and joke that Caelus is on a \"date.\" The trio then encounters King Aldric and Queen Seraphina, who give them a warm, maternal blessing and instruct them to \"Be young. Be happy.\" The King adds an affectionate warning not to let Caelus analyze \"market efficiency.\"\r\n\r\n## Chapter 618: The Weight of Evening Light, Unscripted Laughter, and the Date That Ignored the Plan\r\n\r\nRobin's meticulously planned date is quickly abandoned as Caelus repeatedly stops to help people in need. He assists an elderly market vendor with a heavy basket, rescues a cat named Mr. Whiskers from a window ledge, and repairs a street musician's broken lute string, earning a spontaneous serenade. Caelus is mortified, believing he ruined the plan, but Robin assures him his kindness is the reason she loves him, making the evening better. The three then agree to turn the search for their next location into a game of city-wide hide-and-seek, challenging Caelus to find them using only his understanding of their personalities. Caelus starts by correctly deducing Lingsha's personality and heads to acquire honey cakes for her first.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 621: The Weight of Negative Intelligence, Wandering Soldiers, and the Fountain That Held Peace\r\n\r\nCaelus stops at a bakery to buy honey cakes for Lingsha, using the visit to gather \"negative intelligence\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dconfirming the baker hadn't seen her and thus eliminating that path. He next encounters Commander Gareth, Commander William, and several soldiers taking a night off at a tavern. They also report not seeing Lingsha and are highly amused when Caelus explains he is playing \"city-wide hide and seek,\" calling it \"adorable.\" Using process of elimination and his deep knowledge of her, Caelus deduces Lingsha has chosen a peaceful, safe, and private place related to her priestess role, correctly identifying the Solara Fountain. He finds her there, and she is deeply touched that he knew her heart well enough to find her. He gives her the honey cakes, which brings her to tears of happiness. Lingsha shares a piece of cake with him, and they leave together to find Robin.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 622: The Weight of Fish Logistics, Cold Complaints, and the Wall That Marked the Edge\r\n\r\nCaelus, Lingsha, and Liora move toward the market district, where Caelus combines the search with grocery shopping, stopping to buy fresh salmon for the next morning's breakfast for \"efficiency.\" The fish vendor confirms seeing Robin heading north. Caelus then carefully acquires a blueberry tart with a dark chocolate crust for Robin, ensuring the fish Lingsha is holding does not affect its \"aromatic integrity,\" revealing he has memorized all their favorite desserts. They encounter Commander Astraea, who hasn't seen Robin but mentions the city wall entrance was \"quite cold.\" Caelus immediately grins, deducing that Robin, being tactical and literal, used a temperature anomaly to leave a clue and placed herself at the \"maximum possible range\" of the search perimeter: the highest point on the city wall. He announces his intention to \"gently, affectionately\" pinch her cheeks as a tactical response to her deliberate maximum-range positioning. They begin climbing the wall's access stairs, with Caelus expressing his admiration for Robin's brilliance.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 623: The Weight of Pinched Cheeks, Perfect Deductions, and the Tart That Tasted Like Victory\r\n\r\nCaelus, Lingsha, and Liora find Robin sitting on the wall's summit, silhouetted against the night sky. Caelus first sets down the blueberry tart, then immediately reaches out and gently but firmly pinches both of Robin's cheeks. While she is momentarily speechless, he breaks down his flawless tactical deduction: that she used the cold as a message via Astraea, that she chose the wall for its perfect tactical awareness to watch his search, and that she chose the maximum permissible distance to test him while simultaneously choosing the most beautiful view as a gift. Robin's eyes fill with tears of emotion from being so thoroughly understood. Caelus releases her, gives her the blueberry tart, and she confirms he solved every layer of her strategy. Robin confirms she will say yes if he ever proposes, even if it is through an equally oblivious method like discussing fish preparation. Caelus, still oblivious to the romance of his actions, then begins planning their next morning's salmon sushi breakfast based on everyone's individual preferences.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 625: The Weight of Desperate Volunteers, Survivor's Fire, and the Selection That Would Save the World\r\n\r\nThe chapter details a critical planning meeting in the training command room with Prince Sunday, Princess Robin, Caelus, Commander Helena, and Commander Astraea regarding the volunteers for the eight-stack enhancement program.\r\n\r\n* **Volunteer Pool and Requirements:** Out of over three thousand total volunteers, approximately four hundred and eighty meet the baseline technical requirements, which include a four-stack minimum innate blessing compatibility. Beyond technical skill, the most critical requirement is the psychological capacity to endure the physical destruction and temporary nervous system overload caused by the enhancement while maintaining tactical clarity.\r\n* **The Lumora Volunteers:** Former priests and priestesses are identified as having consistently exceptional qualification rates due to their spiritual discipline and high blessing compatibility. One hundred and forty-three of these volunteers are from Lumora, the city where Caelus died, and they possess the highest psychological resilience scores in the entire pool.\r\n* **Survivor's Motivation:** These Lumora volunteers are survivors who experienced Valthor's presence and watched Caelus sacrifice himself. They are volunteering to ensure that what happened to their city never happens again and to stand beside the Hero who died for them, proving they can carry part of the burden.\r\n* **Selection Decision:** Seventy-eight of the Lumora volunteers meet all technical qualifications, representing the strongest concentration of candidates. The command team agrees to prioritize this group to form the foundation and set the standard for the final defense force.\r\n* **Caelus's Demand:** Deeply moved by the fact that these people are volunteering to break themselves because they watched him die, Caelus insists on meeting every single one of the seventy-eight prioritized candidates. He wants to know their names and their stories to ensure he sees and understands the magnitude of their sacrifice.\r\n* **Conclusion:** The survivors of Lumora will form the core of the force that ensures Caelus will not have to die alone again. Caelus accepts that he must endure the emotional toll of meeting them, ensuring their sacrifice is recognized and that they receive the best training possible.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 626: The Weight of Morning Freedom, Pigeon Landings, and the Letter That Carried Seventy-Eight Names\r\n\r\nCaelus is officially released from house arrest. He carefully extracts himself from Robin, who was clinging to him in her sleep, by promising blueberry pancakes. Liora teases him for having been so bored during his rest that he alphabetized the salt varieties in the kitchen. A messenger pigeon delivers a letter to Caelus from Celestine in Lumora, informing him that the seventy-eight Lumora volunteers are gathered and waiting to share their stories with him. The letter relays a message from the volunteers stating, \"We're not doing this because we're brave. We're doing this because you showed us what bravery looks like. And we want to be worthy of the Hero who thought we were worth dying for.\" Deeply moved, Caelus prepares to make breakfast before informing his family of the travel plans to Lumora.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 627: The Weight of Bitter Beginnings, Honey Lessons, and the Names That Demanded Recognition**\r\n* **Part 1:** The Hero Party is gathered for a chaotic morning breakfast. Caelus serves the others the blueberry pancakes that Robin had requested while half-asleep.\r\n* **Part 2:** The pancakes are unexpectedly bitter, shocking everyone. Caelus explains he made them this way intentionally, using a honey-mint mixture to show that bitter things need sweetness to become whole and perfect.\r\n* **Part 3:** Caelus reveals the true reason: he received a letter from Celestine. Seventy-eight survivors from Lumora who watched him die are volunteering for a high-risk enhancement program and want to share their stories with him. He used the pancake lesson to prepare for the emotional burden of turning their \"bitter beginnings\" into meaningful sacrifice. The party decides to travel to Lumora together.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Chapter 628: The Weight of Borrowed Baskets, Unspoken Worry, and the Portal That Carried Purpose**\r\n* **Part 1:** While Robin and Lingsha prepare for their own urgent duties in Solphire, Caelus 'borrows' a huge basket of kitchen ingredients for the trip. He expresses his primary concern about the journey is that Celestine is overworking herself organizing the meetings.\r\n* **Part 2:** Liora steps in and decides she will take Caelus to Lumora immediately using a demonic portal. This allows Caelus to check on Celestine and begin the meetings, while Robin and Lingsha stay in Solphire to complete their essential tactical and medical preparations.\r\n* **Part 3:** Lingsha gives Caelus the key to her private chamber in Lumora. Robin makes him promise to stop the meetings if he feels overwhelmed. Caelus and Liora step through the portal, heading toward the temple, with Caelus promising to wait for Robin and Lingsha to join him that night.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Chapter 629: The Weight of Silent Portals, Intertwined Fingers, and the Promise That Required Twenty Names**\r\n* **Part 1:** Caelus and Liora arrive in Lumora via a discreet portal. They find Celestine in her administrative office, completely exhausted and overwhelmed from her organizing efforts. Liora immediately intervenes and forces Celestine to stop working and rest.\r\n* **Part 2:** Caelus cleans Lingsha's nearby chamber, cooks food for Celestine, and ensures she rests and bathes. They then go to the temple, and Caelus begins the individual meetings, listening to the intense trauma narratives of the first eighteen volunteers.\r\n* **Part 3:** After the cumulative weight of the stories becomes too much, Celestine immediately stops the meetings, guiding Caelus to a secluded, private healing bath (onsen). She forces him to rest and recover, fulfilling their family's promise to ensure he does not break alone.\r\n\r\nOf course. Here is a summary for each chapter part from the provided text.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 630: The Weight of Scattered Documents, Borrowed Authority, and the Kitchen That Promised Care**\r\nCaelus and Liora arrive in Lumora a day early and find Celestine overwhelmed and exhausted in her office, buried under the administrative chaos of preparing for the volunteer meetings. Recognizing her catastrophic state, Liora uses provisional authority granted by Lingsha to forcibly take over Celestine's duties. She then orders Caelus to take Celestine away to rest and eat. Caelus leads a weary Celestine to Lingsha's borrowed chambers, where he cooks her a comforting meal (her favorite honey-ginger chicken) that he had planned for, showing his care and attentiveness.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 631: The Weight of Borrowed Beds, Settled Dust, and the Dress That Carried Home**\r\nAfter eating, an exhausted Celestine is put to bed in Lingsha's chamber by Caelus. While she sleeps deeply, Caelus occupies himself by thoroughly cleaning the dusty, neglected room as an act of basic courtesy and to ground himself. When Celestine wakes, refreshed and having bathed, she changes into one of Lingsha's dresses. She and Caelus then prepare to face the first of the volunteer meetings, with Caelus admitting he is not \"okay\" with it but is determined to do it because the volunteers deserve to be seen.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 632: The Weight of Eighteen Stories, Scattered Limbs, and the Garden That Witnessed Breaking**\r\nCaelus and Celestine begin the volunteer meetings. Eighteen survivors share their traumatic stories of the day Caelus died, each one detailing horrific scenes of death, despair, and Valthor's cruelty. Caelus listens attentively, but the accumulated weight of the testimonies becomes too much. After the eighteenth story, Celestine recognizes he is on the verge of a complete breakdown and forcibly ends the session. She leads him to a private garden, where he collapses and vomits, sobbing as he confronts the devastating realization that his sacrifice and death were \"not enough\" to stop Valthor's horror.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 633: The Weight of Borrowed Towels, Stiff Muscles, and the Water That Promised Healing**\r\nSeeing Caelus's muscles locked in a stress response after his breakdown, Celestine takes charge. She informs Liora of the situation and then firmly guides Caelus to the temple's private onsen for therapeutic treatment. She gives him a five-minute ultimatum to change and enter the water. Once in the healing, herb-infused water, they sit together in silence, beginning the process of physical and emotional release.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 634: The Weight of Touching Skin, Bitter Pancakes, and the Nonsense That Anchored Sanity**\r\nSitting beside Caelus in the onsen, Celestine provides grounding physical contact. To pull his mind away from the trauma, she asks him to tell her \"ridiculous\" stories from his life. Caelus shares absurd and humorous anecdotes, like making deliberately bitter pancakes as a philosophical lesson and having a one-sided conversation with a wyvern about fish. The shared laughter provides a crucial emotional release, helping Caelus remember that his life contains more than just trauma and pain.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 635: The Weight of Towel Betrayal, Family Circles, and the Enemy That Never Stayed Tied**\r\nRobin, Lingsha, and Liora portal directly from Solphire, having felt Caelus's breakdown through the soul bond. They join Caelus and Celestine in the onsen. Instead of interrogating him about the trauma, Liora lightens the mood by teasing him about his towel coming untied, declaring him at war with the \"Demon Lord of Towels.\" The moment erupts into cathartic, family-wide laughter, reinforcing their bond and providing Caelus with the profound security of knowing his family will always choose to be with him, even in his most broken moments.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 636: The Weight of Morning Assessment, Distributed Burdens, and the Roles That Carried Trust**\r\nThe family wakes up together after a night spent sharing Lingsha's bed. They formally discuss the previous day's events, and Celestine confirms that Caelus kept his promise by accepting intervention before completely breaking. To better support him for the remaining meetings, they devise a plan: Lingsha will handle administrative duties, Celestine will remain as Caelus's primary support in the meetings, and Robin and Liora will wait outside as emergency oversight. This system distributes the burden and establishes clear, protective roles.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 637: The Weight of Managed Rotation, Grounding Touch, and the Success That Felt Like Victory**\r\nFor the second day of meetings, Celestine implements a new strategy. She has reorganized the schedule to alternate between \"hard\" and \"manageable\" trauma stories. During difficult testimonies, she provides grounding touch by holding Caelus's hand; during lighter ones, she gives him space. This managed rotation prevents the compound devastation of the first day. Caelus successfully endures thirty meetings, stopping when Celestine directs him to, exhausted but functional. This is celebrated as a major victory.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 638: The Weight of Twenty-Nine Testimonies, Final Witness, and the Light That Flickered Alone**\r\nOn the third day, Caelus listens to twenty-nine more testimonies. For the final session, Celestine has scheduled Michael, whose story is one of hope and inspiration. Michael reframes Caelus's death not as a failure, but as a foundational miracle. He describes Caelus as a \"single light flickering against darkness\" whose sacrifice inspired others to become lights themselves, vowing that the anti-Valthor soldiers will stand beside him, not behind him, in the final battle.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 639: The Weight of Iris Foundations, Blooming Soldiers, and the Palm That Promised Standing Beside**\r\nMichael continues his testimony, describing the Iris Fountain that miraculously bloomed where Caelus fell, a sacred site for survivors. He passionately reiterates that the anti-Valthor soldiers are not weak or in need of protection but are capable warriors who have consciously chosen to stand beside their Hero. He extends his hand to Caelus, symbolizing this vow of solidarity, declaring that while Caelus is the \"miracle\" (Hero, singular), they are the \"iris that bloom from that miracle\" (heroes, plural).\r\n\r\n**Chapter 640: The Weight of Trembling Acceptance, Brutal Training, and the Question That Made Heroes Laugh**\r\nCaelus accepts Michael's hand and formally welcomes him into the anti-Valthor unit, warning him of the brutal training and low survival odds. As the profound moment seems to conclude, Michael awkwardly but sincerely asks if Commander Astraea is single, wanting to pursue a romantic interest alongside his military commitment. The absurd question breaks the tension, causing Caelus to laugh genuinely for the first time in days, and he encourages Michael to \"shoot his shot.\"\r\n\r\n**Chapter 641: The Weight of Empty Stalls, Stolen Noodles, and the Chaos That Meant Family**\r\nWith all seventy-eight meetings complete, Celestine leads the exhausted Caelus and his family to a noodle stall in a market street that holds significance from their past. The owner has cleared the stall for them in gratitude for Caelus's past kindness. The meal quickly devolves into a chaotic, joyful \"noodle warfare\" with everyone stealing food from each other's bowls. This shared laughter and absurdity serves as a perfect, healing conclusion to their emotionally devastating ordeal, reaffirming the comfort and strength of their family bond.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Chapter 642: The Weight of Borrowed Time, Stolen Plans, and the Tomorrow That Promised First**\r\nCaelus tries to recover from the emotional toll of listening to seventy-eight trauma testimonies, but his mind continues to spiral into tactical planning. Liora intervenes, forcing him to rest and promising that the logistics for the next day are already handled. Meanwhile, Robin, Lingsha, and Liora conspire to give Celestine a \"date\" with Caelus, framing it as a day of rest so he will accept it without guilt. That night, the family rearranges their sleeping formation to let Celestine sleep beside Caelus, who comforts her with his presence and accepts her into the fold of the family.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 643: The Weight of Dawn Extraction, Kitchen Sovereignty, and the Breakfast That Tasted Like Devotion**\r\nThe next morning, Robin, Lingsha, and Liora execute a tactical retreat, leaving Caelus and Celestine alone under the guise of administrative duties. Celestine asks to cook breakfast, impressing Caelus with shrimp dishes that utilize the specific techniques he taught her. Caelus is overwhelmed with pride at her mastery and devotion. The other women watch from a distance as the pair leaves for the market, celebrating that their plan to give Celestine a day of joy is working perfectly.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 644: The Weight of First Entry, Kitchen Notes, and the Tent That Promised Secrets**\r\nCaelus visits Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private residence for the first time, admiring her organized herb garden and efficient kitchen. While there, he discovers her meticulous notes on his cooking lessons and sees the Caelus doll she keeps by her bed, interpreting them as signs of diligence and a need for comfort rather than romance. Celestine retrieves a tent from her wardrobe, asking Caelus to trust her with a mysterious plan for the day, which he does without hesitation.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 645: The Weight of Unfiltered Words, Star Hats, and the Girl Who Stopped Being a Priestess**\r\nCelestine changes into a lavender dress, prompting Caelus to call her \"cute\" in a moment of unfiltered honesty that leaves them both blushing. In the market, Caelus spots a straw hat embroidered with stars and buys it for her, declaring that for today, she is not a priestess but just a girl on vacation. The gesture of protection and care moves Celestine deeply. The three wives watch from afar, pleased to see Caelus learning to express care through small, non-tactical gifts.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 646: The Weight of Silent Assembly, Magical Disasters, and the Hands That Refused to Let Go**\r\nCelestine leads Caelus to a secluded sanctuary by the river where they set up the tent with perfect, wordless synchronization. They agree to rest before cooking, lying face-to-face inside the tent. As Caelus drifts off to sleep, he holds Celestine's hand and refuses to let go even after losing consciousness. Celestine remains awake, cherishing the realization that he feels safe enough with her to let his guard down completely.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 647: The Weight of Shared Fish, Absurd Constellations, and the Praise That Shattered Everything**\r\nThe pair catch a catfish and cook dinner together under the stars. As night falls, Caelus entertains Celestine by renaming constellations with ridiculous names like the \"Warrior's Tomato.\" In a moment of sleepy drowsiness, Caelus tells Celestine that if she ever gets a husband, that man will be very lucky. While he means it as the highest praise, Celestine is heartbroken by the implication that it won't be him, though she cherishes his vulnerability as he falls asleep on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 647 (Revised): The Weight of Shared Warmth, Whispered Truth, and the Hand That Refused to Let Go**\r\nMoving into the tent for the night, Caelus is stripped of his defenses by exhaustion. In this unfiltered state, he corrects his earlier sentiment, whispering that if *he* got the chance to be her husband, he would be happy. He falls asleep immediately after this accidental proposal, still holding her hand. Celestine weeps with joy, finally believing that there is hope for them, and whispers her love back to his sleeping form.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 648: The Weight of Morning Rituals, Kingdom Summons, and the Breakfast That Tasted Like Tomorrow**\r\nThey wake up still holding hands and pack up camp with domestic efficiency. Upon returning to Celestine's home, she receives a letter carried two responbility: 1. a large summit will be held at lumora, preparation for final war. 2. one month later after summit, celestine is being assigned to Solphire for two weeks to observe training, meaning she will be reunited with Caelus and the family soon. Caelus cooks breakfast in her kitchen, solidifying the feeling that he belongs in her space. Before leaving, he confirms that he meant what he said the night before about being happy with her, leaving Celestine full of hope for their future.\r\n\r\nuntil 642 chapter 648 is celestine and caelus date, from morning to the night.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 649: The Weight of Oblivious Returns, Uncontrolled Laughter, and the Calm Before Tomorrow's Storm**\r\nCaelus returns to Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chambers feeling a shift in his perspective after his time with Celestine, though he remains romantically dense. When Robin calls him an \"oblivious hero,\" Caelus genuinely looks around the room for the person she is referring to, causing Robin, Lingsha, and Liora to collapse into uncontrollable laughter. Liora orders him to bathe just to give them time to recover. Afterward, the group utilizes a portal to return to Solphire, shifting their mindset from domestic joy back to the heavy responsibilities of the impending war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 650: The Weight of Divergent Duties, William's Command, and the Doctrine That Refused to Break**\r\nUpon returning to Solphire, the group immediately splits to handle their respective duties. Caelus and Lingsha observe William commanding three thousand soldiers on the training grounds. William has evolved into a brilliant teacher, instilling adaptive strategies and critical thinking in his troops rather than demanding blind obedience. Lingsha notes that they are building not just military strength, but a collective belief in survival, preparing the army to contest impossible odds.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 651: The Weight of Strategic Deception, Partner Coordination, and the Siblings Who Would Teach Through Action**\r\nSunday approaches Caelus and Liora with a strategic request to solve a training issue regarding partner coordination. He asks them to participate in the day's drills using their disguised identities, \"Kael and Kela,\" to demonstrate attainable excellence in teamwork. Caelus and Liora agree to limit their powers to a standard soldier's level and act as siblings, viewing the assignment as a chance to both teach the army and enjoy a few hours of fun and normalcy together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 652: The Weight of Ordinary Excellence, Exploited Flaws, and the Lesson That Required No Words**\r\nDisguised as Kael and Kela, Caelus and Liora enter the training grounds and engage in two-on-two combat drills. They defeat various partnerships not with overwhelming power, but with flawless synchronization and tactical awareness. Instead of dominating, they turn every match into a lesson, explaining their opponents' flaws and teaching them how to cover for one another. Their accessible excellence inspires the other soldiers to believe they can achieve similar coordination.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 653: The Weight of Rain-Soaked Joy, Commander's Assessment, and the Dance That Taught Through Laughter**\r\nHeavy rain transforms the training ground, and while others complain, Kael and Kela laugh and play, teaching the soldiers to view the weather as an asset. Commander Astraea and William challenge the siblings to a match. Through a series of intense engagements, Kael and Kela help the commanders refine their own coordination, demonstrating that perfect partnership relies on instinct and trust rather than rigid planning, all while maintaining their joyous cover.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 654: The Weight of Shared Umbrellas, Borrowed Coins, and the Drinks That Tasted Like Understanding**\r\nAfter the training concludes, Caelus and Liora revert to their true forms but maintain their sibling dynamic. Liora insists on sharing a single umbrella and treating Caelus to food and warm drinks at a local caf\u00c3\u00a9. They spend the evening writing a tactical analysis report for Sunday while sharing pastries and swapping teas. It serves as a cherished moment of peace and family connection before the return to full operational duty the next day.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 655: The Weight of Strategic Revelation, Family Foundation, and the Truth Hidden in Plain Sight**\r\nRobin and Lingsha force an exhausted Sunday to take a break for dinner, but he manages a quick debrief with Astraea first. Astraea is in awe of Kael and Kela's performance, and Sunday guides her to the realization that the secret to their perfect coordination is not technique, but the deep trust found in family. Satisfied that the lesson was learned organically, Sunday plans to restructure the army's training to foster these deep, family-like bonds among the soldiers.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 656**\r\nCelestine wakes up exhausted before the summit, confiding in her handmade doll of Caelus about his unconscious marriage proposal. Sister Mira intervenes, forcing the overworked High Priestess to delegate tasks and rest, reminding her that true strength lies in accepting help just as the Hero is learning to do. Together with the temple staff, they finalize the summit agenda, preparing to position Lumora as a neutral spiritual sanctuary to hold the fractured kingdoms together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 657**\r\nPrince Wales of Alabasta gets lost in the temple garden and falls in love at first sight with the sleeping Celestine. He bravely confesses his feelings, but Celestine gently rejects him, revealing that her heart belongs to the oblivious Hero, Caelus. They bond over the unrequited nature of her love and Caelus's traumatic history, and Wales accepts his heartbreak with scholarly grace, agreeing to remain friends.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 658**\r\nPrince Sunday and Commander Helena visit the Iris Fountain, which has become a pilgrimage site blooming with impossible flowers where Caelus was resurrected. Overwhelmed by the tangible proof of miracles and the heavy cost of Caelus's sacrifice, Sunday breaks down and apologizes to the hero's memory for his past antagonism. He resolves to protect Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctity from political corruption, recognizing it as the essential spiritual foundation for the coming war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 659**\r\nIn a private strategic meeting, Prince Sunday reveals to Celestine and Mira that the allied kingdoms are on the verge of economic collapse and that desperation is driving some humans to consider betraying the alliance to the demons. He urges Lumora to serve as an unshakeable moral anchor to prevent humanity from turning on itself. Celestine accepts this heavy burden, promising that the city will provide the spiritual conviction necessary to keep the alliance united.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 660**\r\nOn the morning of the summit, Celestine bonds with Princess Seraphine over their shared, complicated love for the oblivious Hero and the kindness he showed when rejecting Seraphine's marriage proposal. United by their personal resilience and respect for Caelus, Celestine opens the summit breakfast with a powerful call for unity. She urges the gathered delegates to stop acting like politicians and start acting like a family fighting for love.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 661**\r\nCelestine leads the formal summit session, where kingdoms report high military adoption of the anti-Valthor doctrine but reveal critical economic instability, with Sunstone admitting it faces bankruptcy in eight months. Identifying that their military progress is endangered by resource shortages, Celestine rallies the delegates to commit to a total resource-sharing network. The session concludes with a unanimous, emotional pledge of solidarity from all nations to stand with Lumora and survive together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 662: The Weight of Impossible Offers, Severed Heads, and the Vision That Shattered the Heart of the World**\r\nDuring the open session of the summit, Lord Matthias of Greymark presents a horrific proposal from demon scouts: if humanity executes Caelus and displays his severed head on the Irish Fountain, several demon lords will retreat. While Prince Sunday furiously rejects the idea as psychological warfare, Celestine is traumatized by the mental image of the desecration. The summit descends into chaos as terrified delegates begin to genuinely consider betraying their Hero for a chance at survival.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 663: The Weight of Forced Silence, Sobbing Princesses, and the Calculation That Promised Annihilation**\r\nSunday and Aldric forcibly suspend the session to stop the chaos, leaving the core allies alone in the empty hall. While Princess Seraphine breaks down over humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to betray Caelus, Sunday formulates a counter-strategy based on cold logic. He calculates that executing Caelus would turn neutral powers like Liora, Kronos, and Azrith into active enemies, guaranteeing humanity's extinction rather than saving it. They resolve to present this irrefutable calculation the next day.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 664: The Weight of Demonic Authority, Unified Threats, and the Question That Made Kingdoms Tremble**\r\nLiora interrupts the morning session, dropping her disguise to reveal herself as a Demon Lord accompanied by two succubi. She issues a terrifying ultimatum to the delegates: harming her \"little brother\" Caelus will result in immediate annihilation from her forces, along with the armies of Kronos and Azrith. Terrified by the realization that betraying the Hero would create a second demon front, the delegates are bullied into silence and forced to abandon the treasonous proposal.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 665: The Weight of Hidden Observation, Divine Conversations, and the Privilege That Made Flowers Smile**\r\nSeeking solace, Celestine finds Caelus at the Irish Fountain, happily communicating with the Goddess Solara about cooking vegetables. Liora joins her, and they watch him from the shadows, realizing he is completely oblivious to the recent plot against his life. Touched by his innocent connection to the divine, the women resolve to keep the dark truth secret to protect his peace as he cheerfully invites them to dinner.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 666: The Weight of Family Gambles, Spicy Tears, and the Flight That Left Questions Behind**\r\nCaelus cooks dinner for Celestine, Liora, and Prince Wales, introducing a chaotic \"family tradition\" involving a bowl of incredibly spicy rice. Celestine endures the spicy portion with tears in her eyes to honor his effort, deepening their bond. Afterward, Caelus reveals his divine form to fly Liora home, leaving Wales awestruck. Wales admits he cannot compete with such a being but agrees to support Caelus as a loyal friend and ally.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 667: The Weight of Morning Prayers, Sacred Ground, and the Lesson Written in Blood-Soaked Earth**\r\nOn the final morning of the summit, Celestine and Sister Mira lead the delegates in prayer at the Irish Fountain. Mira recounts the brutal reality of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacrifice and resurrection on that very spot, shaming the delegates for considering its desecration. As the flowers glow in response to their vows, the delegates are overcome with remorse and recommit themselves to protecting the Hero who died for them.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 668: The Weight of Final Calculations, Brutal Truths, and the Peace That Required Annihilation**\r\nPrince Wales presents the final war strategy, revealing a grim plan that relies on \"mutual annihilation\" to secure lasting peace. He outlines a two-pronged defense where the Hero Party engages Valthor while the main army holds off millions of demons, predicting catastrophic casualties of up to fifty percent. The delegates, sobered by the honesty and the terrifying cost of survival, applaud the strategy and steel themselves for the coming apocalypse.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 669: The Weight of Honest Farewells, Committed Hearts, and the Doll That Witnessed Everything**\r\nAs the summit concludes, Prince Wales receives closure regarding his unrequited feelings, and Celestine reaffirms that her heart belongs entirely to Caelus. Exhausted from saving the man she loves from political betrayal, Celestine retreats to her room and confides in her handmade Caelus doll. She falls asleep finding peace in the knowledge that Caelus remains safe, happy, and completely oblivious to the danger he narrowly escaped.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 670: The Weight of Fevered Rest, Unexpected Care, and the Porridge That Tasted Like Home**\r\nCelestine succumbs to severe exhaustion and fever following the intensity of the summit, unable to leave her bed. Caelus arrives unexpectedly at her high priestess private residance to invite her to a party with Robin and Lingsha but, realizing she is sick, immediately abandons the plans to take care of her. Despite her embarrassment, Caelus takes charge of her kitchen to cook a ginger-honey porridge that brings her to tears because it tastes like home. He tends to her fever with a damp cloth and gentle words, prioritizing her health over the celebration, which fills Celestine with a profound sense of peace and safety.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 671: The Weight of Borrowed Keys, Forehead Blessings, and the Access That Promised Everything**\r\nCaelus remains by Celestine's side but becomes anxious about the others waiting for him. Sensing his conflict, Celestine urges him to join his family but offers him a spare key to her residence so he can return efficiently, a gesture that symbolizes granting him permanent access to her private life. Caelus accepts the key and, before leaving, adjusts her blankets and kisses her forehead\u00e2\u20ac\u201da learned gesture of familial care that leaves Celestine overwhelmed with emotion. Alone again, she realizes he is practicing his capacity for love on her, and she vows to wait for him forever.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 672: The Weight of Borrowed Innocence, Immortalized Shame, and the Album That Promised Endless Teasing**\r\nCaelus arrives late to his surprise party, terrified of the consequences, only to find Robin, Lingsha, and Liora waiting with cake and a \"punishment\" prepared. Liora reveals an old album of drawings she made of Caelus when he was six, depicting his absurd childhood heroics like fighting rivers and trying to rescue chickens. The teasing dissolves into warmth as the women celebrate the boy who has always tried to carry the world, affirming that his protective nature is innate.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 673: The Weight of Scattered Keys, Dark Humor, and the Home That Refused Furniture**\r\nCaelus proposes a \"sky dance\" for Lingsha at sunset, poetically comparing his partners to different times of day to ensure everyone feels equally valued. He displays his collection of their house keys but sadly jokes about having no home of his own, prompting a fierce intervention from the women who insist *they* are his home. Caelus accepts this but immediately ruins the emotional moment by practically stating he prioritizes a good kitchen over emotional security.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 674: The Weight of Equal Portions, Accidental Poetry, and the Times of Day That Held No Favorites**\r\nThe group visits the sick Celestine, where Caelus force-feeds her porridge for recovery. He explains the scheduling for Lingsha's flight and inadvertently devastates the women with accidental poetry, assigning each of them a specific time of day\u00e2\u20ac\u201dDawn, Mid-morning, Evening, and Night\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat perfectly matches their personalities. They realize he manages to love them all equally and individually, finding his oblivious romance perfect.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 675: The Weight of Pillow Rights, Kitchen Priorities, and the Laughter That Held Everything**\r\nWaking up trapped by his partners, Caelus successfully negotiates \"Pillow Rights,\" arguing that he should be allowed to use them as pillows in the future. He earnestly thanks them for making him feel at home, only to immediately undercut the sentiment by reasserting his need for a kitchen over emotional safety. The women drag him to cook breakfast, celebrating their chaotic, warm, and genuine family dynamic.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 676: The Weight of Proper Requests, Confused Permissions, and the Surprise That Refused Spoiling**\r\nCaelus formally requests airspace permission from Sister Mira to prevent panic during Lingsha's flight, impressing the priestess with his unnecessary consideration. Back at Celestine's residence, he prepares food and refuses to spoil the surprise, though he admits to having multiple backup plans. The women realize he is creating a shared memory for the whole family to witness Lingsha's moment.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 677: The Weight of Borrowed Care, Delegated Joy, and the Preparation That Promised Everything**\r\nCaelus intimately cares for Celestine, establishing a pact of mutual care that leaves her overwhelmed with hope for a future where she can look after him. He instructs Robin and Liora to bring Celestine to watch the evening's event, explaining that while the moment belongs to Lingsha, he wants the whole family to witness how he sees her. Lingsha trusts him completely as they leave to prepare for the miracle.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 678: The Weight of Flower Seeds, Visible Shoulders, and the Comet That Carried Evening**\r\nLingsha wakes up and dresses in a freeing, modern outfit that leaves Caelus stunned by her beauty. After gathering hundreds of flower seeds, Caelus activates his divine form at the Irish Fountain. He lifts Lingsha and launches them into the sky like a golden comet, while his family watches from below, ready to witness the spectacle.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 679: The Weight of Bottomless Energy, Red Faces, and the Question That Promised Forever**\r\nHigh above Lumora, Caelus explains his plan to use their unified energy to make flower seeds bloom in mid-air and fall like rain. After a clumsy attempt to trigger the capability through embarrassment, Lingsha kisses him with a prayer, transferring the halo and granting her access to his infinite energy. With golden swords holding the seeds, they prepare to rain flowers upon the city.\r\n\r\nit's caelus and lingsha date \r\n\r\n**Chapter 680: The Weight of Clumsy Kisses, Overflowing Output, and the Tree That Shouldn't Exist**\r\nLingsha struggles with the energy output until Caelus initiates a \"tactical kiss\" that unleashes a torrent of power. Instead of falling flowers, the energy creates a massive, permanent tree rooted on a floating golden platform above the city. Caelus is confused by the deviation but declares it perfect, interpreting the impossible growth as a true reflection of Lingsha's nurturing spirit.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 681: The Weight of Falling Flowers, Heaven's Questions, and the Hunger That Would End Miracles**\r\nThe observers on the ground marvel at the floating tree raining warm, comforting flowers upon Lumora. Their awe turns to hysterical laughter when they realize the divine miracle's duration depends entirely on Caelus's hunger, only to remember he packed bread, ensuring the impossible structure will persist into the night.\r\n\r\nit's lingsha and caelus date\r\n\r\n**Chapter 682: The Weight of Stepped Toes, Falling Flowers, and the Dream That Tasted Like Bread**\r\nCaelus proves to be a terrible dancer on the floating island, stepping on Lingsha's feet repeatedly. However, Lingsha notices that the tree releases a flower with every mistake, interpreting it as beauty found in imperfection. After Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loud stomach interrupts the romance, they share bread, and he outlines his post-war dream: a home that is also a restaurant where the whole family works together. Lingsha is moved to tears by his oblivious but perfect proposal of a shared future.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 683: The Weight of Empty Stomachs, Eating Fabric, and the Miracle That Dissolved for Noodles**\r\nCaelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hunger becomes urgent, leading him to threaten to \"eat\" Lingsha if they don't leave, though he is completely confused by the sexual innuendo and worries about the nutritional value of her clothes. Deciding noodles are more important than architectural miracles, he dissolves the floating island. On the ground, the women watch the divine structure vanish and collapse into laughter, realizing their Hero unmade heaven simply because he wanted dinner.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 684: The Weight of Falling Together, Dark Humor, and the Noodles That Waited for Heroes**\r\nPlummeting from the sky, Caelus jokes about crashing together, while Lingsha admits that a world without him is scarier than death. He activates his wings at the last second for a safe landing, only to find that Sister Mira has brought the entire noodle feast to the fountain. The family eats together under the stars, teasing Caelus about his hunger and his accidental threats, celebrating that while miracles are temporary, their bond is forever.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 685: The Weight of Lazy Mornings, Crying Commanders, and the Flower That Healed Everything**\r\nThe group wakes up tangled together in Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed, with Caelus serving as the central pillow. Celestine discovers her fever is completely gone, healed by the residual blessing of the flowers she caught the night before. Caelus and Lingsha cook breakfast for the family, enjoying a final moment of domestic peace and laughter before they must return to Solphire and the war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 686**\r\nPrince Sunday, King Aldric, and Queen Seraphina observe the Anti-Valthor unit easily dismantle a probe of twelve thousand demons. Despite the flawless victory, Sunday reveals a grim truth: Hell is not trying to conquer them yet, but is sacrificing troops to calibrate their attacks and map humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defenses. He realizes they are trapped in a war of attrition where every victory provides Valthor with data to kill them more efficiently in the future.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 687**\r\nDemon Lord Liora visits Sunday secretly, offering him a network of succubi spies embedded in Hell to provide real-time intelligence on enemy movements. She explains that she is doing this solely to ensure Caelus survives the war. Sunday is skeptical but agrees to a test case; Liora predicts a specific attack in Valcrest in four days. Sunday prepares a list of trusted allies to receive the network's communication crystals if the intel proves true.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 688**\r\nSunday and Squad Ironshrine deploy to Valcrest in civilian disguises to verify Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intelligence. The attack occurs exactly as predicted, and the squad holds off eighteen thousand demons to protect civilians until Valcrest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main forces\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalerted by Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u201darrive to wipe out the enemy. With the intelligence verified and zero casualties sustained, Sunday and King Mordain agree to fully trust the demon network.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 689**\r\nSunday gathers trusted leaders from across the allied kingdoms and reveals the existence of the demon intelligence network. He distributes the communication crystals, explaining that their survival depends on trusting demons who are loyal to Caelus. Despite the risks and the treasonous nature of the alliance, the leaders bind the crystals with blood, accepting the network to gain a tactical advantage in the coming war of attrition.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 690**\r\nJust as the council accepts the crystals, a massive alert comes through: Valthor is constructing three fortresses simultaneously on Earth to shore up his political power, and the terrifying ancient dragon Bahamut has appeared. The Hero Party is forced to abandon the war effort to hunt the dragon, leaving humanity just eighteen hours to destroy the three fortresses on their own before they become permanent staging grounds.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 691**\r\nSunday initiates \"Operation Ant Triumph,\" ordering Commanders Astraea and Gareth to split their elite forces to attack the three fortresses. Facing odds of one hundred to one and lacking any support from the Hero Party, the commanders accept the suicide mission. They plan to use superior coordination and doctrine to swarm the massive demon garrisons across three continents simultaneously.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 692**\r\nIn Lumora, High Priestess Celestine shares a quiet farewell with her parents(at celestien parent home) before deploying for the assault. Alone in her room(at celestine private residance), she confesses her hidden love to a handmade doll of Caelus while she's naked and in the proceed of changing dress. She reveals she possesses a golden feather shed from his wings that stays warm as long as he is alive, and she packs it as her only comfort and anchor for the impossible battle ahead.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 693**\r\nPrince Sunday gathers fifteen hundred soldiers in Lumora for \"Operation Ant Triumph,\" announcing he will personally lead this front because his instinct warns of unique danger. With the Hero Party remaining in Solphire to counter the threat of the dragon Bahamut, Sunday emphasizes that this battle relies entirely on military doctrine and coordination. Despite the catastrophic odds of facing one hundred thousand demons, the army move to the battlefield with high morale, ready to prove that humans can topple giants.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 694**\r\nUpon arriving at the coordinates, the army finds only empty ground. Sunday uses the demon spy network to confirm the fortress exists but is cloaked by massive invisibility magic, validating his instinct about the danger. Elite Squad Seven uses enhanced sight to reveal the eighty-seven thousand-strong demon garrison. Sunday rallies the troops, crediting the demon spies for the intelligence, and the army prepares to assault a fortress they can now see through magical countermeasures.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 695**\r\nElite Squad Seven breaches the fortress walls, secures the gate, and kills a demon general, allowing the main force to enter. As the battle escalates, rain begins to fall, washing away the demons' invisibility advantage and revealing their positions. Utilizing past training from Caelus on fighting in adverse weather, the human forces turn the rain into a tactical asset, seizing the momentum against the disoriented demon army.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 696**\r\nThe battle intensifies as Elite Squad Seven is intercepted by twelve demon generals simultaneously. During the chaotic melee, Celestine suffers broken ribs from a sneak attack but refuses to retreat, using her healing magic to keep her squad operational. through desperate coordination and Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power, the squad systematically eliminates all twelve generals, proving their doctrine can withstand overwhelming elite power.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 697**\r\nVictory is interrupted by the arrival of a Demon Lord Candidate, a massive entity wielding a black shield and earthquake magic. The monster casts a \"black veil\" over the fortress, cutting off all external communication and trapping the human forces inside. Isolated and facing an apex predator that reshapes the terrain with every blow, the soldiers struggle to survive as the entity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domain magic turns the tide against them.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 698**\r\nAmidst the devastation, Celestine is struck by debris and brought to the brink of death. Refusing to succumb, she bites Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golden feather and writes a prayer in the air with her blood. Solara answers her devotion with a massive, temporary blessing that allows Celestine to ignore her critical injuries. She rises to heal her squad, fueled by love and divine power, keeping the army alive against the Lord Candidate's onslaught.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 699**\r\nSunday analyzes the Demon Lord Candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movements and identifies a structural weakness in its chest armor. Celestine sacrifices the last of her energy to cast a final blood-prayer, boosting Astraea to twelve blessing stacks before collapsing into unconsciousness. With this overwhelming power, Astraea leads a precise, coordinated strike that pierces the demon's heart. The entity falls, the black veil shatters, and humanity achieves a miraculous victory.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 700**\r\nAfter the Demon Lord Candidate is defeated, the ancient dragon Bahamut appears and launches a devastating laser attack to test humanity's durability. Refusing to let her soldiers die after surviving the battle, Astraea uses Caelus's golden feather and a desperate blood-prayer to activate the fallen enemy's legendary shield. The barrier successfully withstands the divine blast, satisfying Bahamut's curiosity enough for the dragon to leave, securing a miraculous survival for the exhausted human forces.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 701**\r\nSunday struggles with the heavy guilt of a twelve percent casualty rate despite achieving total victory across three fronts(12% casualty in lumora fortess, 5% at each fortress in valcrest and ashenvale ). Caelus and Robin arrive, revealing they engaged Bahamut in a sky battle to ensure the dragon left after its test. Liora comforts Sunday, reframing the survival rate as a tactical miracle rather than a failure given the overwhelming odds. With his confidence restored, Sunday joins the Hero Party and Liora in organizing the recovery efforts to bring the survivors home.\r\n\r\noperation 'ant triumph' succed. 3 Fortress breach and single demon lord candidate is eliminated, while the hero party didn't even need to intervene.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 702**\r\nCelestine wakes in excruciating pain from the backlash of her miracle, but finds Caelus holding her to help ground the agony. While he tenderly feeds her, Robin validates the mechanics of Celestine's blood-prayer and asks for the new blessing's name. Celestine names it \"Dawn Blessing\" after a story about a \"Dawnkeeper\" who refused to surrender, silently dedicating the name to Caelus and the lesson of resilience he taught her.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 703**\r\nCaelus visits the heavily bandaged Astraea, teasing her about looking like a mummy to help lift her spirits. Despite her catastrophic injuries, Astraea regains her competitive fire, promising to discipline Caelus once she heals. She reveals the legendary shield is named \"Night Watch\" and declares that it has chosen her as its new guardian, securing a powerful mobile defense asset for humanity's future battles.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 704**\r\nCelestine wakes in excruciating pain from the backlash of her miracle, clutching Caelus's feather. Caelus arrives to clean her wounds and change her bandages, performing the intimate task with absolute reverence and gentleness. Overwhelmed by his care and her own injuries, they both shed tears, but the moment solidifies Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s realization that his acts of service are his way of showing love.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 705**\r\nLiora takes Astraea to the medical tent to explain the true nature of her new shield. The artifact is a semi-sentient, prideful weapon from Hell named \"Night Watch.\" Liora reveals that the shield chose Astraea because they share the same stubborn, protective personality, and Astraea formally accepts the bond and the strict conditions required to wield it.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 706**\r\nAs the army prepares to leave, the Night Watch shield refuses to be moved by the soldiers, making itself impossibly heavy out of pride. Caelus uses his divine form to carry the \"sulking\" shield to the transport wagon, earning its respect through a display of power. He then carries Celestine to the carriage in a princess carry, and the group departs for Lumora.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 707**\r\nThe convoy is halted by the sudden appearance of Bahamut, terrifying the soldiers. However, the dragon is not attacking; it drops a massive narwhal head as a \"gift\" of gratitude for the earlier entertainment. Caelus and Robin use their unified capability to play tag with the dragon in the sky, turning a moment of terror into a joyful game before Bahamut departs.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 708**\r\nBack in Lumora, Caelus shocks the local priesthood by using his holy powers and flying swords to fillet the massive narwhal in the town square. He organizes the priestesses to cook the meat, turning the dragon's gift into a city-wide feast. The celebration helps the citizens and soldiers heal from their trauma through food and community.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 709**\r\nRobin, Lingsha, and Liora visit Celestine with a secret plan. They reveal that an upcoming political meeting involves dangerous debates regarding Caelus's safety, and they refuse to let him attend. They task Celestine with keeping Caelus occupied and oblivious at her home, vowing to handle the dark politics themselves to protect his innocence.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 710**\r\nTo ensure Caelus stays away from the temple meetings, Celestine asks him to help clean her sticky wounds personally. Caelus performs the task with deep emotion, crying over the damage to her body and blaming himself, though Celestine reassures him. He talks about future dates he wants to take her on, completely unaware that she is protecting him from the political summit.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 711**\r\nCaelus spends the day baking coffee-cocoa cookies in Celestine's kitchen. As they share the treats, he entertains her with embarrassing stories about the other party members, including Robin's sulking and a prank war between Lingsha and Liora. The domestic peace cements Celestine's feeling of truly belonging to their family while the others handle the world outside.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 712**\r\nPrince Sunday concludes a tense summit with allied delegates, securing approval for the new military doctrine and a strict non-aggression policy regarding the dragon Bahamut. Lingsha and Liora warn the assembly that the demon intelligence network must be used solely for peace, revealing that Liora is personally watching for any treachery. The delegates reaffirm their vow to protect Caelus, rejecting the dark temptation to betray him for political safety. The Hero Party returns to Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home, content to shoulder the burden of the world's darkness so Caelus can remain innocent and happy, baking cookies with his friend.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 713**\r\nCommanders William and Gareth encounter a sudden demonic rift while traveling, and their squads dismantle the threat with elite coordination. A surviving demon general offers William a deal: behead Caelus in exchange for easier war terms from Valthor. William instantly kills the demon, revealing that his motivation is not just survival, but a deep, personal vengeance against the Demon King. The commanders realize these desperate offers prove that Valthor is terrified of humanity's growing strength and unity.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 714**\r\nTen days after the operation, three thousand soldiers return safely to Solphire, having proven that human coordination can stand against demons. The commanders compare reports and find that every captured demon is offering the same deal to exchange Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head for peace. Astraea reveals she used her new shield, Night Watch, to execute a general making that same offer. The commanders agree that betraying Caelus would only prove Valthor right and destroy their alliance, resolving to maintain absolute unity.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 715**\r\nAstraea addresses the troops, announcing that Caelus will soon arrive to test them against ten percent and fifteen percent divine power\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe baseline for humanity's survival. She admits she has not mastered Night Watch and challenges the soldiers to a spar to help her find her weaknesses. Flamewing Squad is selected for the match, and they eagerly accept the chance to test their legendary commander, promising to exploit her lack of control over the semi-sentient shield.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 716**\r\nThe spar between Astraea and Flamewing Squad begins, quickly revealing Astraea's lack of synchronization with Night Watch. The shield triggers its ultimate defense accidentally, draining her energy, and fires offensive pulses wildly off-target. Flamewing Squad adapts to these flaws, outmaneuvering Astraea and forcing her to yield due to exhaustion. Astraea accepts the loss with grace, vowing to master the stubborn, prideful artifact through relentless training.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 717**\r\nAstraea struggles alone in the early morning until Caelus and Robin intervene. Caelus explains that legendary weapons require partnership and trust, not just mechanical control, demonstrating his own connection to his sword via prayer. Following his advice, Astraea offers her blood and a sincere prayer to Night Watch, asking for its help. The shield responds to her humility, establishing a deep bond that instantly improves their synchronization to eighty percent and allows her to aim its attacks.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 718**\r\nPrince Sunday watches a rematch between Astraea and Flamewing Squad to gauge her progress. This time, Astraea uses her new connection to consciously activate a controlled ultimate defense, holding a massive, impenetrable barrier for thirty minutes against constant assault. Though she eventually yields from energy depletion, she proves she can deploy a \"mobile fortress\" capable of saving armies. Sunday leaves the training ground with renewed hope, believing humanity finally has the tools to survive the coming war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 719**\r\nHigh Priestess Celestine arrives near Solphire to inspect the massive crater left by Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous power demonstration. Prince Aldric explains that the preserved destruction serves as a reminder to the soldiers of the apocalyptic power they must learn to contest. Her professional duties finished, Sister Mira releases Celestine to go find her \"family.\" Clutching Caelus's golden feather, Celestine heads for the castle, eager to reunite with the Hero who possesses the power to destroy the world but chooses to protect it instead.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 720**\r\nCaelus and Robin return to Solphire completely covered in mud after Caelus uses his divine wings to assist with a difficult pig birth at a local farm. Robin wails dramatically about the indignity, while Liora and Lingsha dissolve into laughter at the absurdity of the Hero using god-given powers for livestock midwifery. Celestine arrives and happily joins the muddy embrace, reuniting the chaotic family and diffusing Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horror with shared laughter and warmth.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 721**\r\nDuring a family dinner, the group laughs about the pig farm incident before Caelus solemnly requests permission to test his limits at twenty percent divine power in the desolate Broken Wastes. He theorizes that power beyond fifteen percent causes \"reality warping,\" similar to the environmental destruction seen in Hell. King Aldric grants permission on the condition of strict safety measures, and Robin, Lingsha, and Celestine insist on accompanying Caelus to ensure he survives the experiment.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 722**\r\nA sudden crisis erupts as the sky turns blood-red; the Demon King Valthor has deployed ten million demons to build a fortress at the Broken Wastes to save face politically. The War Council realizes that to prevent total war, Caelus must destroy this threat alone to prove humanity's dependence on him. While the leaders scramble for a strategy that balances survival and political optics, Caelus silently prepares himself to become a weapon of mass destruction once again.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 723**\r\nCaelus enters the war room drenched in sweat from preparation and agrees to the suicide mission, but asks his partners to stay behind. Robin, Lingsha, and Celestine refuse, vowing to die with him rather than let him face the apocalypse alone. United by this grim promise, the four prepare to use their \"Unified Capability\" to amplify Caelus's power, while Astraea is assigned as the fail-safe to activate the legendary shield Night Watch if they fall.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 724**\r\nAt the rally point, Astraea refuses to remain a bystander and forces her way into the mission, prompting fifty-three priestesses to buff Caelus with one hundred blessing stacks. The group marches to the fortress, where Robin kisses Caelus to activate their Unified Capability, forcing the divine halo onto her own head. Despite the agonizing time dilation and sensory overload, Robin endures the burden so they can breach the enemy stronghold together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 725**\r\nCaelus flies Robin into the fortress, where she drops a massive glacier to breach the gates before they begin slaughtering thousands of demons inside. However, a hidden Demon Lord Candidate ambushes them, shattering Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ribs and forcing him to draw the cursed sword Solareth. The curse instantly inflicts the pain of a million deaths upon Caelus, which transmits through the soul bond to Robin and Lingsha, knocking Robin unconscious and incapacitating Lingsha kilometers away.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 726**\r\nOperating in a reality-warped state of compressed time, Caelus dissects the Demon Lord Candidate and massacres the demon army while carrying the unconscious Robin. Although Robin briefly wakes to obliterate a second enemy with a pillar of lightning, the pair is eventually overwhelmed by four fresh Demon Lord Candidates. Succumbing to catastrophic wounds and exhaustion, Caelus collapses, and they are left bleeding and dying together on the fortress floor.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 727**\r\nRealizing the team is dying, Astraea and Celestine sprint into the fortress, aided by Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood-prayer that grants Astraea supernatural speed. Astraea arrives just in time to deploy Night Watch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultimate barrier, shielding the fallen couple from a killing blow. Inside the barrier, a critically injured Robin uses a desperate kiss to activate \"Temporal Reversal\" magic, destroying her own body to rewind time for Caelus and restore him to life before they both collapse.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 728**\r\nCaelus wakes up just as the ancient dragon Bahamut tears through reality, enraged that his friends were hurt. As Bahamut charges an erasure beam, Caelus grabs the women and flees, ordering Astraea to deploy a massive shield to protect Solphire from the blast. Bahamut fires, erasing the entire fortress and the ten-million-strong demon army from existence in an instant, leaving the Hero Party battered but alive in the aftermath of the dragon's vengeance.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 729**\r\nIn the quiet aftermath, Lingsha joins the pile of exhausted survivors, diagnosing Caelus with full-body muscle lock and Robin with severe neurological strain, intense headheace. Prince Sunday and the medical team arrive, overwhelmed with relief to find them alive. Refusing to be separated, the broken but victorious \"family\" piles into a single carriage to return home, leaving behind a massive crater as a testament to their survival. sunday said that liora will bring a good news tomorrow.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 730**\r\nLingsha and Celestine begin a nightly care routine for the immobilized Caelus and Robin, whose bodies are locked up from the previous battle. Despite Caelus and Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intense mortification at being washed while they are naked, treated, and dressed like children while helpless, they accept the care while refusing to let go of each other's hands. The priestesses declare they will perform this intimate service for three days until the couple recovers, framing it as a non-negotiable act of love.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 731**\r\nLiora and Queen Seraphina visit the recovering couple, bringing breakfast and maternal blessings. The group discusses the strategic aftermath of the battle, noting that the Demon King is terrified because the ancient dragon Bahamut intervened. The room dissolves into laughter when they realize the absurd truth that Caelus has accidentally befriended the world-ending dragon, and Queen Seraphina leaves with peace of mind, knowing her daughter is surrounded by people who would rewrite reality to save her.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 732**\r\nThe care routine escalates as Liora joins Lingsha and Celestine to perform deep tissue massage and trigger point therapy on the paralyzed pair. The physical release of tension forces Caelus and Robin to finally let go of their emotional stoicism, leading to shared tears of relief and trauma. After the agonizing but necessary treatment, the women watch over them as they fall into a nightmare-free sleep, safe and completely loved. but liora, lingsha, and celestine deliberetly let caelus and robin sleep in naked. while the girls sleep at diffrent chamber, wondering how the event will turn around.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 733**\r\nCaelus wakes up to find himself and Robin completely naked and entangled in bed, the others having intentionally left them that way. After a mutual panic upon realizing their predicament and the fact that their \"family\" orchestrated it as a prank, Robin decides she is too exhausted to care. Instead of retreating, she demands \"five more minutes\" of sleep and snuggles closer to him, accepting the comfort and intimacy despite the embarrassment.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 734**\r\nAt a nearby cafe, Liora, Lingsha, and Celestine laugh hysterically about the success of their plan to force Caelus and Robin into an awkward romantic situation. They later meet with Sunday and Astraea to reschedule the military assessment for three days later. They explain that this specific timeline is a strategic trick: by giving Caelus a deadline, his sense of responsibility will force him to pace his recovery properly rather than overtraining immediately.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 735**\r\nDuring lunch, the three women admit to the flushed Caelus and Robin that they deliberately left them naked to force them to relax. They inform Caelus of the rescheduled assessment, and as predicted, he accepts the delay as a necessary strategic period, unknowingly falling into their trap to ensure he rests. The meal concludes with a sense of warm, teasing familial bond, with Robin silently accepting her place beside the Hero.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 736**\r\nAstraea and Prince Sunday announce to the army that the Hero will demonstrate ten percent of his divine power in three days and that only four squads will be selected to participate in the exercise. With Elite Squad Seven already holding one spot, the remaining units compete in brutal sparring matches to earn the right to stand on the front lines. Gareth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Enhanced Squad secures the second slot, leaving the rest of the army to fight for the final two positions the following day.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 737**\r\nLiora, Lingsha, and Celestine execute a mischievous plan to force Caelus and Robin into intimacy by leaving them alone for the night to perform a \"naked care routine\" on one another. Though initially mortified, Caelus and Robin realize they genuinely need physical assistance due to their lingering injuries. Moving past the embarrassment, they wash each other with reverence and eventually share a small bathtub, finding deep peace and safety in their shared vulnerability.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 738**\r\nWhile in the bath and still naked, Robin breaks down in tears, releasing the suppressed trauma of the Solareth curse and the pain of the Temporal Reversal spell she used to save Caelus. Caelus holds her until she stabilizes, and their bond deepens as they physically support each other out of the tub when Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs fail. Later, the other women return with dinner, teasing the couple but affirming that their shared vulnerability makes them stronger, and the group settles in to sleep as a family.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 739**\r\nCaelus and Robin observe the military sparring matches to select squads for the upcoming assessment. While watching, Caelus frantically begs Robin to keep their intimate care routine a secret from Prince Sunday, terrified of his brother-in-law's reaction. Sunday and Astraea oversee the brutal elimination rounds, looking for the soldiers capable of surviving the Hero's power, while Caelus and Robin bond over their shared, embarrassing secret.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 740**\r\nLiora visits the neutral demon Lord Azrith, who invites Caelus to a tribal celebration to demonstrate to his people that the Hero is a friend, not a monster. Azrith reveals he violently rejected bribes to betray Caelus, and Liora admits she has threatened seventeen demon lords with conceptual erasure for similar assassination plots. Azrith expresses profound respect for Caelus and looks forward to the chaos the Hero will inevitably bring to his kitchens.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 741**\r\nThe ancient dragon Bahamut appears over Azrith's stronghold, playfully chasing a terrified wyvern in a game of tag. Azrith and Liora discuss how Caelus befriended the primordial entity through play rather than dominance, securing humanity a powerful ally that even the Demon King fears. Witnessing the dragon's newfound joy, Azrith finds hope that if an ancient monster can learn to play, his people can learn to live in peace.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 742**\r\nThree thousand soldiers gather to witness the assessment of the Hero Party, with Prince Sunday and Prince Aldric enforcing strict perimeter control. While the squads prepare with nervous anticipation, Caelus and Robin lie together in a field of grass far from the command tents. Caelus expresses his fear that Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lingering injuries from the Solareth curse and Temporal Reversal spell make her participation dangerous, but Robin fiercely shuts him down. She reaffirms her vow to stand beside him in both agony and ordinary life, causing Caelus to break down and finally accept her devotion with a tearful thank you.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 743**\r\nRobin helps Caelus stand, symbolizing a shift in their dynamic where she supports him. They activate their unified divine form through a prayer-kiss, merging their consciousness and sharing the burden of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power. The assessment begins with Elite Squad Seven and Enhanced Squad launching a coordinated assault, but Caelus and Robin dominate the air with perfect synchronization. To counter their aerial advantage, Commander Astraea achieves perfect synchronization with her legendary shield, Night Watch, creating a massive mobile platform that lifts the soldiers into the sky to fight on equal footing.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 744**\r\nThe battle escalates as the soldiers use a technique pioneered by Commander William to strip Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine capability with concentrated strikes. Realizing they are being boxed in, Caelus and Robin decide to overwhelm the enemy with a massive tactical escalation. They fly high above Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barrier, drop a massive sphere of ice to weaken it, and then Caelus turns himself into a living meteor using gravitational manipulation. The impact shatters the legendary barrier and devastates the battlefield, leaving the soldiers scattered but alive.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 745**\r\nImmediately following the meteor impact, Astraea orders an attack to exploit the microsecond recoil delay in Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine form. The exhausted soldiers swarm the Hero, landing strike after strike by targeting the instability in his wings. Despite Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desperate magical defense, the soldiers manage to land ten clean hits before collapsing from catastrophic exhaustion. The engagement ends with the soldiers earning a moral victory for proving humanity can contest godhood, while Caelus comforts a weeping Robin, proud that she forced him to fight seriously.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 746**\r\nLiora, Lingsha, and Celestine tend to the exhausted couple, teasing them about their intimacy while providing medical care. They move Caelus and Robin to a private carriage, where the women box Caelus in to ensure he rests. Lingsha mischievously suggests the couple might need another \"private care\" session, flustering them both. The group travels back to the castle in high spirits, prioritizing Caelus and Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emotional and physical recovery over definitions of their relationship.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 747**\r\nThe second engagement begins with Ironshrine and Flamewing squads. Commander Thorn leads Flamewing in a reckless, chaotic assault of fire and noise designed solely to overwhelm Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senses and create a smokescreen. Hidden within the environmental chaos, Commander William and Ironshrine squad move silently, using the distraction to approach Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blind spots. As Robin focuses on countering the magical barrage, William prepares to strike at the exact moment Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instincts are overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 748**\r\nIronshrine executes a perfect ambush, stripping Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine capability with coordinated strikes. William uses a dangerous technique to absorb eight stacks of blessings into his own body, shattering his sword but allowing him to deliver a devastating blow to Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structural focal point. The attack reduces Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine capability from ten percent down to three percent. The soldiers collapse in victory, having successfully brought a god to his knees through sheer tactical brilliance and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 749**\r\nInstead of ending the assessment, Caelus ascends into the sky and summons a massive storm, returning moments later at full power. He uses this terrifying display to teach the soldiers the final, grim lesson: demons do not stop when they are tired, and giving an enemy time to breathe allows them to recover. After the heavy lesson, Caelus relaxes and plays in the rain he created, tasting the water with childlike joy while his family watches affectionately.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 750**\r\nThe group retreats to a private onsen for relaxation. When Caelus enters, his towel accidentally comes undone, and in a panic, he activates a \"Divine Modesty Protocol.\" The resulting pressure wave causes everyone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s towels to fall as well, leaving the entire group naked and mortified. Liora breaks the tension with hysterical laughter about the \"fair distribution of the curse,\" and the group eventually settles into the bath, bonding over the absurdity of the moment and their shared closeness.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 751**\r\nFive friends play a game of Truth or Dare in the onsen that quickly shifts from playful to deeply emotional. Liora reveals Caelus once tried to arrest a chicken as a child, while Robin and Celestine confess their profound fear of losing him and their desire for closeness. Despite the intense mortification of their shared secrets, the group bonds over their vulnerability, affirming their love for one another as a chosen family.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 752**\r\nFollowing the bath, the women enforce strict ryokan etiquette, insisting Caelus wear a yukata with nothing underneath. After he reluctantly complies, the group retires to their suite where the sleeping arrangements are predetermined: Caelus is positioned in the center of the futons to serve as a pillow for the women. They fall asleep in a \"cuddle pile,\" reinforcing their comfort and intimacy.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 753**\r\nDuring a dawn soak, Caelus suffers a towel malfunction and claims to have adopted a \"Stoic\" philosophy of acceptance to salvage his dignity. The women playfully weaponize his logic by discarding their own towels, forcing a shared and hilarious vulnerability. Caelus eventually laughs at the absurdity, and the group finds freedom in being completely unmasked together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 754**\r\nAt breakfast, Caelus becomes manically enthusiastic about the buffet, prompting Liora to sit on his lap to physically slow down his eating. The group discusses Caelus and Liora's upcoming diplomatic trip to a demon tribal celebration. After exchanging affectionate farewells and promises to make family memories upon their return, Caelus and Liora depart through a portal to Hell.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 755**\r\nArriving at Liora's castle, Caelus faces teasing from the succubi who view his trip as a romantic excursion. Sylvia explicitly points out that attending a festival together for days resembles a date. Caelus discovers that Liora keeps his formal wear stored next to hers, realizing that to the outside world, they present as a coordinated, paired unit.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 756**\r\nCaelus and Liora arrive at the Shattered Peaks, the massive territory of the ancient demon lord Azrith. They witness a warrior demonstration where Dullahan soldiers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dformer subordinates of a lord Caelus killed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhonor him for granting their master a warrior's death. Caelus is introduced to Azrith's three wives and the demon lord himself, who welcomes them with genuine warmth and trust.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 757**\r\nAzrith's wives show the guests to their quarters, teasingly providing a single room with one large bed based on the assumption that Caelus and Liora are a couple. Liora explains that this is how the world perceives their bond. They settle into the bed together, discussing the stability of Azrith's rule and the nature of their own relationship before falling asleep hand-in-hand.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 758**\r\nThe ancient dragon Bahamut arrives to play tag with a wyvern, delighting the demon populace who view it as a sign of good fortune thanks to Caelus's influence. During the opening feast, Caelus is baffled by headless Dullahan drinking wine but accidentally charms everyone with his innocent confusion. Lord Azrith gives a speech honoring Caelus not just for his strength, but for the respect he showed to the fallen demon lord Dreadnox, cementing Caelus's status as an honored guest.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 759**\r\nAs the feast turns into a banquet, Caelus treats the food selection like a tactical operation, meticulously curating a plate for Liora based on her specific taste preferences. They feed each other in a display of profound, natural intimacy that the watching demons recognize as deep trust. Liora is moved by Caelus's devotion to her happiness, telling him that his care is a form of love even if he doesn't have the vocabulary for it yet.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 760**\r\nAzrith publicly thanks Caelus for transforming the dragon from a lonely god into a playful friend, but Caelus humbly worries about paying for the vegetables he used to feed it. Later, Caelus asks the Dullahan for help preparing food for the dragon's next visit; they scold him for asking politely instead of commanding them as a respected warrior. Back in their room, an exhausted Caelus drifts off to sleep and finally tells Liora he loves her, leaving her weeping with joy at the long-awaited admission.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 761**\r\nCaelus and Liora attend the warrior demonstrations in the colosseum, where Caelus struggles to suppress his tactical analysis while watching the Dullahan's perfect coordination. Inspired by the mutual respect among the fighters, Caelus proposes a future where human and demon warriors guard borders together for defense rather than conquest. Azrith and his wives agree that the idea is naive and impossible, which is exactly why they agree to try it after the war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 762**\r\nThe celebration shifts to a chaotic territorial race involving monstrous mounts and magic. Caelus borrows a brave headless horse named Night-stride and invites Liora to ride with him, prioritizing a shared experience over winning. While other racers launch with explosive speed and flight magic, Caelus and Liora trot along leisurely, laughing at the absurdity of a race where physics is optional and enjoyment is the only goal.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 763**\r\nThe race reaches the deadly Razor's Edge cliff just as Bahamut flies overhead playing tag. Caelus seizes the opportunity and rides Night-stride off the eight-thousand-meter cliff, using his divine wings to control their fall. They land successfully on the oblivious dragon's back, turning the race into an impossible adventure where a human, a demon lord, and a headless horse hitch a ride on a god.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 764**\r\nTo steer the dragon toward the finish line, Caelus and Night-stride recklessly climb up Bahamut's neck to its head. Caelus uses energy swords to gently guide the fleeing wyvern, causing Bahamut to unwittingly follow the race route. They cross the finish line just ahead of Azrith, winning the competition by hijacking a dragon, cementing Caelus's legend as the most creatively insane hero in Hell's history.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 765**\r\nCaelus and Liora share an intimate moment feeding each other at the feast while joking about Robin's potential reaction to the race. Bahamut contributes two massive fish heads, which Caelus and the Dullahan expertly butcher and cook. Caelus establishes a ritual of trust by flying the prepared dishes directly into the dragon's mouth. The dragon reciprocates with an affectionate nudge, cementing their friendship before Liora drags Caelus back to eat.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 766**\r\nCaelus and the Dullahan deliver the final massive fish dish into Bahamut's mouth using a strict safety protocol, earning the crowd's applause. Bahamut then clumsily mimics an invitation gesture, offering rides to the attendees. A diverse group, including Caelus, Liora, and Azrith's wives, climb aboard. The dragon launches into a powerful flight, sharing the joy of movement and companionship with its passengers high above the Shattered Peaks.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 767**\r\nBahamut transports the group to Layer Three, revealing a stunning endless ocean under twin moons, before moving to Layer Four, a time-warped desert filled with mirrors. The mirrors reveal a heartbreaking truth: Bahamut has always been and is predicted to always be eternally alone. Devastated, Caelus rallies the group, declaring that they can rewrite this fate by choosing to be present now, and the passengers vow to ensure the dragon never faces that loneliness again.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 768**\r\nUpon returning to the Shattered Peaks, Caelus initiates a group embrace of the dragon's snout, joined by the passengers and eventually the entire crowd. Azrith and the demons offer their warmth after learning of the dragon's cursed solitude. Caelus tells Bahamut directly that it is loved and no longer alone, causing the primordial entity to shed a tear as it finally understands the reality of friendship and acceptance.\r\n", "created_at": "2025-12-06T13:41:00.191175+00:00"}]}, {"uuid": "019aca53-2d19-7547-9d8d-61c27a943180", "name": "How to use Claude", "description": "An example project that also doubles as a how-to guide for using Claude.

She enjoys teasing Caelus, hiding her affection behind playful smiles, but her love is pure and unwavering.\r\n\r\nHer only wish is to see Caelus soar freely, unburdened by pain. To make that possible, she secretly endures the torment of the Solareth Cure, a medicine that slowly breaks her mind. The quiet nosebleeds and dizziness she hides are the price she willingly pays for his happiness. Even as the pain consumes her, she finds peace in his smile \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to her, that light is worth everything. but liora love was Obsessive and caelus accept it, like it's natural. \r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\n\r\n- Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most cherished memory is of a day long past 17 years ago, when she hid from the demon army in a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s form and met a young Caelus, who little caelus shared his last three dirty rice balls with her.

She is caring, soft-spoken, and easily flustered, with the innocent charm of a younger sister who wants to help everyone around her. Yet beneath that gentle nature lies a powerful mind \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the true strategist and magical genius of the party. Her love for Caelus is deep but unspoken, sealed behind shy smiles and soft glances.

Still, her heart bears scars no one sees. on the hero journey, after caelus take solareth from a stone and solareth curse nearly took Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life, she kissed his bloodied lips to cool his overheat brain with her magic \u00e2\u20ac\u201d an act that saved him but left her haunted. Since that day, the sight or scent of his blood fills her with terror and sorrow, a memory she hides even from Liora. She remembers the warmth of his blood, her tears mixing with it on her lips, and his body resting lifelessly on her lap through the night. It was the moment she realized how much she loved him\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and how much she feared losing him again.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\n\r\n- robin New abilites: Temporal Reversal spell, once per week. rewind time for a single person, at most is 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n- robin had a secret memories of sexsual night with caelus, but caelus at that time is lossing control. only robin and liora know about this, and both women won't tell anyone(only liora and robin know about it), so robin is certified not virgin anymore.\r\n\r\n- from Arch 21 and on, robin is afraid sleep alone. she can't sleep alone, so there is always caelus and lingsha on her bed. robin personal bedroom is became hero party chamber (a chamber for robin, caelus, lingsha and liora).\r\n- robin was a possessive cat, since kronos incident robin always slept atop caelus chest. except she was beaten through rock, paper, scissors.\r\n- after chapter 544. robin could accesss at caelus divine form, by kiss caelus with prayer. and so for lingsha.\r\n\r\n## Lingsha ( Age: 20 )\r\n\r\nplace of Birth: lumora \r\n\r\nLingsha, the twenty-year-old priestess of the Hero Party, is both a healer and a beacon of warmth wherever she goes.

Her devotion to her faith is genuine, but her heart has already been stolen by the very hero she travels beside \u00e2\u20ac\u201d though he remains blissfully unaware. Her compassion often becomes her burden: she understands others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 emotions so well that she forgets her own, always putting Caelus and her companions before herself.

This hug was very warm, like Solara herself giving warmth to Caelus, and also hiding Caelus's cries like a child in front of the people there.\r\n\r\n## Arc 17\r\n\r\nJust as Caelus was recovering, the king ordered him to immediately finish off Aquila, who was bound by magic. Aquila began to struggle, and before she could lose control, Caelus had to finish her off.\r\n\r\nWith a single draw of Solareth, Caelus successfully finished off Aquila, leaving her exhausted and in the arms of Robin and Lingsha.\r\n\r\n## Arc 18\r\n\r\nHero party discus about liora in hell against valthor.

The hero party's plan is to tell the king about their next journey, a journey no human has ever attempted: entering hell.\r\n\r\nThe hero party's journey is to save Liora from Valthor. However, the hero party disguises their purpose by saying it is to understand the structure of hell and find out the whereabouts of Valthor, who suddenly disappeared during the last great war.\r\n\r\nKing and queen didn't doubt caelus and robin, they give full support for hero and their journey. the king and queen just hope that the hero party didn't throw away their live easily, hope for all of them to return.\r\n\r\nAstraea who is trusted friend of hero party join the journey. other than hero party, only astraea who know liora identity.\r\n\r\n## Arc 21  (Ch. 98 - 107)\r\n\r\none day before going to hell. robin sleep alone on her room, it' unusual for her.\r\n\r\nRobin wakes from Kronos's vision, traumatized by seeing Caelus die fifty different ways.

Kronos speaks privately to Robin: he'll summon two god-tier entities (Giant Dullahan and Bahamut) to prove Caelus will die. But it's a \"playground\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddeath is temporary, he'll resurrect them. He wants to see if Robin can change fate. Landscape transforms to vast, empty plain.

Remembers Liora saying Solara responds to strong will (like Caelus in cemetery). Robin steps forward despite wounds and lightning, demanding Solara's help\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot prayer but declaration. She refuses to accept fate. A divine presence acknowledges her: \"Show me your strength, child.\"\r\n\r\nRobin runs toward dying Caelus, wounded by demons and lightning. Her mind suddenly accelerates\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSolara's blessing giving her 1000% mental capacity. She understands Liora's magic, Fourth Layer mechanics, everything.

They proceed to Fifth Layer portal.\r\n\r\n## Arc 22 (Ch. 108 - 109)\r\n\r\nFlashback to capital war: Liora confronts Valthor directly alone. She understood: he's exhausted, not evil. Valthor's Truth:\r\n\r\nWar is theater to unite demons (else they'd destroy themselves) Killing old demon lords using Caelus as grindstone Plans to seal Earth/Hell with Kronos once old powers die Never intended to kill Liora (respects her).\r\n\r\nLiora's Trap: Before Valthor can return to battle, Liora activates Ultimate Mind Prison: Shared Torment. Transfers Solareth's curse (divine, so Valthor can't resist) into shared loop. Both experience million deaths from mortal perspective. liora dies hourly. The Philosopher's Stone:\r\n\r\nLiora compressed her soul for immortality Resurrects her each death Price: no reincarnation when depleted Her entire lineage vanishes when stone shatters She'll never see Caelus's children\r\n\r\nValthor broken by understanding mortal deaths, frozen in the place. Liora ensures he can't threaten Caelus. Both trapped waiting for rescue.\r\n\r\nLiora's perspective: Dying repeatedly, losing sanity. Holds onto memory for warmth: 17 years ago, liora fleeing assassination, hiding in Clearwater Village as child. six-year-old Caelus shares three terrible, burnt rice balls: \"You need them more.\" Shows her his village, ridiculous sword skills, accidentally hits her head with wooden sword. Gives her carved wooden bird: \"So you remember you have a friend.\" That moment defined her existence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfirst time feeling attachment. He became her treasure, her reason for existing. Present: Realizes she won't see his future children. Philosopher's Stone is finite\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe'll vanish completely when depleted. But it's worth it. Calls across dimensions for him to come soon, before stone shatters.\r\n\r\n## Arc 23 ( ch. 110 - 118 )\r\n\r\nHero party ( robin, caelus, lingsha, and astraea ) arrive at the layer 5. run with all their might from demon army into valthor's castle.\r\n\r\nThrone room: Valthor collapsed on floor, broken. Liora suspended in chains, blood everywhere, Philosopher's Stone visible in chest. Both trapped in death/resurrection cycle. Caelus can't stop it\u00e2\u20ac\u201duntil he acts on instinct: forehead kiss (what Liora always did for him). Simple love breaks impossible spell instantly. Valthor's Release: Exhausted, transformed by experiencing million mortal deaths. Orders them to leave\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpayment for freeing him. Won't fight today but promises future battle when recovered.\r\n\r\nPortal to Fourth Layer. Robin calls Kronos for sanctuary. Time Lord provides chamber with normal flow, reveals weeks passed outside.\r\n\r\ncaelus declares he loves his big sister Elira, loves being pampered by her, will tell everyone publicly. Robin and Lingsha add: \"You're our big sister too.\" Liora finally accepts she's not alone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcan be protected, not just protector. Family takes turns caring for each other. She reveals Philosopher's Stone's cost: finite resurrections, no reincarnation, effectively mortal now.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for Liora to recover in Kronos's sanctuary, the Hero Party reflects on their journey through Hell. Robin admits (with embarrassment) that she created her new Temporal Reversal magic in desperation to save Caelus, nearly killing herself in the process.\r\n\r\nLiora pretends to sleep but secretly listens, deeply moved by Robin's confession that she created impossible magic purely out of love for Caelus.\r\n\r\nLiora wakes recovered but weakened. Before returning to Earth, she wants to thank the succubi who helped protect the Hero Party during their descent. Caelus insists on carrying Liora despite her protests, refusing to let her walk until they reach Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u201da reversal of their usual dynamic. Robin, Lingsha, and Astraea mercilessly tease Liora about being carried \"like a princess,\" turning the tables on her usual teasing of Caelus.\r\n\r\nReaching the First Layer with Earth's portal visible, Caelus's stomach growls loudly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe hasn't eaten properly in days. He decides to cook a \"Hell lunch\" using ingredients from the dangerous Verdant Hunger layer, insisting on gathering them while still carrying Liora. Using his spirit wings, Caelus flies through the carnivorous jungle collecting ingredients under Liora's guidance: Nightshade Blooms, Hellfruit Caps, Emberfruit, and silver leaves. Despite dodging deadly plants, he refuses to put Liora down. He successfully prepares a meal from Hell's ingredients, creating something delicious and safe. The party shares this meal before stepping through the portal home, Caelus keeping his promise to carry Liora until they truly reach Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Hero Party emerges from the portal to find hundreds of people waiting\u00e2\u20ac\u201da massive celebration organized by Sunday and Astraea's knights. Despite returning from Hell with visible wounds, the party looks happy and refreshed, leading soldiers to joke about whether they visited Hell or a beach. Sunday has prepared a feast, working his redemption through service. The King and Queen embrace Robin with relief. People notice Caelus still carrying \"Professor Elira,\" but the mood is too joyful for gossip.\r\n\r\nThat night, Robin insists everyone sleep in her room since her bed is largest. Liora admits she doesn't want to sleep alone after being isolated during Valthor's torture\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe wants to stay with family. Caelus is placed in the middle with Robin, Lingsha, and Liora surrounding him. When he asks why they want to sleep beside him (concerned he smells bad compared to their pleasant fragrances), he falls asleep mid-question. The three women share quiet confessions about loving him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin remembering his bloodied kiss that saved his life, Lingsha speaking of his protective nature, and Liora reflecting on seventeen years of watching over him.\r\n\r\nSummary: from Arc 14 until arc 23. liora absence from hero party, because fighting against valthor directly, in hell alone until caelus save liora from valthor.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc 24 ( Ch. 119 - 121 ) | (Character active: robin, caelus, lingsha, liora, sunday, king, and queen  )\r\n\r\nat the morning, Caelus wakes early, carefully extracts himself from the sleeping women, and prepare for cooking. At breakfast with the King, Queen, and Sunday, Liora eats the rice balls and breaks down crying\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey taste exactly like the three burnt rice balls six-year-old Caelus shared with her when she was hiding as a child.\r\n\r\nAt noon, Caelus stands with Liora on the platform and declares loudly to the gathered crowd how much he loves his Big Sister, explaining that family is chosen through love and sacrifice, not just blood.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, Caelus's spirit wings activate without his knowledge, spreading impossibly wide to embrace the entire city. Thousands of golden feathers fall, and every person receives one. Through the feathers, Solara's voice speaks directly to their souls, blessing the entire capital with healing from war trauma. She uses the metaphor of \"rice balls\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsimple love being more powerful than grand gestures.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Arc The Phoenix and the Price of Forever (Ch. 122 - 137)**\r\n\r\nThe peace earned by Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing was a fragile thing, soon tested by duty. The call came to slay a phoenix, a creature of legend that had scorched a land and claimed lives for two long years. With Sunday joining to honor the fallen, Caelus and his family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u201dset out on a mission they knew could be their last.\r\n\r\nTheir journey was a tapestry of light and shadow, showcasing Caelus's gentle power as he disarmed foes with apologies and inspired bandits to reform with gifts of golden hope. Yet, it was the quiet, playful moments\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike Robin and Lingsha demanding to be fed with the same childish affection he showed captives\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat truly bound them, solidifying a family forged in shared, absurd joy.\r\n\r\nThe confrontation at the Far East Castle was a descent into hellfire. The phoenix, Ember-Wing, was a brilliant, regenerating force of nature against which Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holy sword was less effective. The battle raged, leaving Caelus severely burned. In a desperate gambit, Robin orchestrated a complex fusion of blood and ice magic to expose the creature's core, allowing Caelus to strike a shattering blow that forced it to revert to an egg.\r\n\r\nBut from the ashes, hope exploded into despair. The egg detonated, and the reborn phoenix moved to finish a defenseless Caelus. In that heart-stopping moment, Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightmares became reality. Pushing her body and magic beyond all limits, she reached him, casting a forbidden Temporal Reversal. The cost was her own body, bleeding and breaking as she rewound time to restore him, paying the price in agony to buy him a second chance.\r\n\r\nRestored and enraged, Caelus took to the skies with Robin bleeding in his arms, his spirit wings a shield against the fire. He declared \"I've got you forever,\" a vow woven into the very air. When Robin stabilized enough to fight from his embrace, they moved as one\u00e2\u20ac\u201da single entity of divine speed and precise magic. Caelus drew his sword a second and final time, a act that fractured reality and his own mind. He cleaved the phoenix's egg in two, permanently ending the threat, but the curse of his power erupted within his skull, flooding him with a million deaths. His last conscious act was to ensure he and Robin landed safely before darkness claimed him.\r\n\r\nFor two days, he lay unconscious as the land began to heal. Robin kept vigil, her whispered confessions of terror, trust, and helpless love the only sound in the quiet tent. His awakening was perfectly Caelus: criticizing her poorly-measured soup with his first breath, sparking laughter and playful threats that filled the room with the truest taste of home.\r\n\r\nThe final truth, however, was bittersweet. With the arrival of Liora, they learned the phoenix was not a monster, but a mother, Ember-Wing, desperately protecting her nest. Their victory was also a tragedy. As Liora relocated the three remaining stone-like eggs to safety, the party was left to grapple with the complicated aftermath. They had saved countless lives and proven their love could bend time itself, but they now carried the weight of a truth where heroism and heartbreak were forever intertwined.\r\n\r\n## Arc Normal live ( Ch. 138 - 143  )\r\n\r\ncaelus talking with robin in the bed, while lingsha still sleeping. caelus talking the reason why robin use her temporal reversal magic to save caelus when fighting against phoenix. robin say, it's more hurt seeing caelus in pain than her own pain.\r\n\r\ntomorrow afternoon. Caelus insists on attending a council meeting with Robin and Sunday about governing the Far East territory cleared of the phoenix. after that Caelus becomes overwhelmed by the complex debates about governance. In the hallway, she and Sunday gently explain that support doesn't mean forcing himself to participate in battles he can't fight.\r\n\r\nat the evening. caelus goes to market to gather ingredients for \"healing hot pot.\" Along the way, he helps an elderly woman carry fabric for her daughter's wedding dress, comforts a crying boy with a broken toy (giving him a golden feather afterward), and is thanked by a mother whose wounded son was healed by Solara's blessing.\r\n\r\nafter that. He encounters Lingsha shopping for temple supplies and invites her to help gather ingredients. On their way back to the castle, Caelus and Lingsha encounter street musicians playing by the river at sunset. Lingsha asks Caelus to dance with her, and though he initially refuses (remembering his clumsy performance at Sunday's banquet), he sees the quiet longing in her eyes and changes his mind. Despite stepping on her feet multiple times, they dance together as citizens join in, inspired by the Hero and Priestess choosing joy over dignity. After dancing, Caelus adds a small amount of spice to the hot pot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot burning, just enough to make life feel \"alive\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinspired by the lesson that messiness and warmth make experiences real.\r\n\r\ntomorrow At the royal dining table, Caelus serves rice balls\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLiora's favorite from his village. He requests permission to visit Professor Elira's residence to check on her, admitting he misses his sister and worries she's not taking care of herself. The King and Queen remember the previous time these rice balls were served, when Elira broke down crying tears of joy. They grant permission immediately and reveal their jealousy about missing the legendary hot pot that made palace guards cry and the head chef reconsider his entire approach to cooking.\r\n\r\ntomorrow at the way to liora castle. Under the brilliant moon and stars, Caelus begins talking about the night after the Ocean's Edge battle when he carried Lingsha to watch moonlight atop Leviathan's corpse. With complete obliviousness, he recounts intimate details: how she fit perfectly in his arms, her hair smelling like herbs and flowers, her \"cute sleeping sounds,\" holding her hand until she fell asleep. He mentions her poetic phrase \"the moonlight is beautiful, isn't it?\" and his response agreeing about the literal moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc The Child Caelus (Ch. 144 - 160 )\r\n\r\nIn the enchanted silence of Liora's castle, a single, foolish act\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe cracking of a mysterious egg\u00e2\u20ac\u201dunleashed a wave of temporal magic that stripped the hero Caelus of his years and memories, leaving a terrified six-year-old in his place. The women who loved him, Robin and Lingsha, were suddenly cast into the roles of caretakers for a child who did not know them, their journey beginning with awkward meals and night terrors.\r\n\r\nDriven by a desperate hope, they took the boy to the ruins of his childhood home, Clearwater Village, where the utter desolation shattered his innocent world. He fell into a devastating grief, screaming for a mother and a home that were gone, and they held him through the storm, their embrace an unyielding anchor in his collapse. That night, he asked the only questions that mattered: \"Are you my family? Do you love me?\" Their passionate affirmations became the foundation upon which his broken spirit began to mend.\r\n\r\nDays filled with small joys and profound kindness followed. The city of Solphire embraced him, and even his sister Liora returned for a perfect, precious day of stories and magic, her heart breaking even as it swelled with love. On the final morning, the simple, silly chaos of a \"kiss attack\" cemented the feeling of a complete and joyful family.\r\n\r\nWhen the dawn of his return came, Caelus awoke with the dual weight of a man's life and a child's experiences, flooding him with mortification. But the women reassured him with a truth that erased all shame: he had never been a burden, but a gift. To express the inexpressible, he cooked a meal that carried his entire heart, a silent testament to a debt that was not a debt, but a gift of love freely given. They had held him when he fell, and in doing so, proved that even when a home is lost, a family remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Arc VI: The Calm Before the Storm (Ch. 161 - 175)**\r\n\r\nThe warmth of family life, with playful nights in Liora's castle and tender \"not-dates\" in the city, was a precious but fleeting peace. It was shattered by a dire warning from the depths of Hell itself. Liora revealed the devastating consequence of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own heroism: by wielding Solareth to slay five demon lords, he had forced the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand. The 3,000-year war would now end in a final, total demon conquest within one to two years.\r\n\r\nA grim resolve settled over the kingdom. The royal family, now fully united, gave their blessing not just for war, but for Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart, freeing\r\n\r\n# Arc The Burden of Dawn ( 176 - 188)\r\n\r\nIn the quiet dawn following days of rest, Caelus wakes surrounded by those who love him, yet a shadow looms over their peace. A journey to the Legendary Forest reveals a devastating truth carved in ancient stone: the holy blade Solareth is a death sentence for its wielder, bound to Caelus until his last breath. The demons, aware of this fatal flaw, now wage a war of attrition, forcing him to draw the blade and hasten his own end.\r\n\r\nReturning home burdened with this secret, his companions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dweave a web of protection around him. They discover his spirit wings continuously shed golden feathers, each one a blessing that carries not just divine comfort, but the unique, personal essence of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own love. Yet even this miracle is tempered by strategy and sorrow, as a war council confirms their fears: a massive assault is coming to Ocean's Edge Fortress, designed to force Caelus to his doom.\r\n\r\nAmidst frantic military preparations and desperate personal sacrifices, a fragile hope blossoms. Under a full moon, robin ask caelus for a date, liora and lingsha help prepare robin and caelus clothes, and caelus take robin atop castle at the night, dance and watching a beautifull moon, Robin confesses her love in a tender kiss, a quiet promise of a future they may never have. Caelus, beautifully oblivious yet instinctively kind, accepts her heart even as he fails to grasp its full meaning. They stand on the precipice of battle, a hero shielded by secrets and a love strong enough to bend time itself, all racing to prepare for a confrontation that will determine if they can save their world without destroying their hero in the process.\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Ocean's Edge Gambit ( Ch. 189 - 205 )\r\n\r\nThe morning after their rooftop date, Caelus is flustered by a coordinated \"ambush\" of affection from Robin, Lingsha, and Liora. After a final, warm breakfast with the royal family, who reflect on Robin's joyful transformation, the convoy departs for the war at Ocean's Edge. The journey is immediately imperiled by the god-dragon Bahamut, but Robin's brilliant strategy of concealment, using Liora's illusions and Lingsha's arrays, saves them from certain destruction.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival, the weight of their positions settles in. Liora explains her political neutrality prevents her from directly fighting, and Robin is forced to make heartbreaking calculations, ordering Caelus not to use his divine sword, Solareth, even as they watch soldiers die. The battle begins at dawn against three demon lords and their horde. Caelus and his Elite Squad Seven are locked in a desperate dance with the death knight, the Giant Dullahan, suffering heavy losses while trusting Robin's command.\r\n\r\nAs the demon lords unleash their ultimate magics, Robin is forced to play her hand. Caelus draws Solareth, with Astraea bearing the curse, to slay the Nightmare Lord. But the Dullahan responds by unleashing a crippling death aura. To save the entire army, Caelus draws Solareth a second time, absorbing a catastrophic curse to kill the Dullahan before falling unconscious from the strain.\r\n\r\nWith one demon lord remaining and their forces exhausted, Robin faces an impossible choice: let Caelus wake to a potential massacre or risk her own life to save him. Defying all strategic logic, she chooses love. Using her forbidden Temporal Reversal magic, she heals Caelus but collapses from the backlash. Awakened and restored, Caelus understands her sacrifice. He confronts and destroys the final demon lord, but this time, he honors Robin's love by choosing to survive, letting the army handle the cleanup. Victorious but weary, they reunite, hand-in-hand, their bond forged in the terrible fires of command and sacrifice, finally allowing themselves to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc The Burden and Blessing of Survival (Ch. 206 - 207 )\r\n\r\nThe arc begins with the somber Pilgrimage to the Graves, as Caelus, accompanied by Robin, Lingsha, and Liora, visits the mass grave of the eight hundred fallen soldiers. Standing before the grieving families and surviving soldiers , Caelus expresses The Hero's Apology and Prayer, apologizing for his inability to save everyone but immediately honoring their courage and sacrifice. He then offers a public prayer to Solara, imploring her to honor and love the souls of the dead. This prayer is met with Divine Acknowledgement as Caelus's spirit wings manifest and release exactly eight hundred golden feathers, one for each grave , providing immense comfort to the mourners by individually acknowledging the value of every sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe arc shifts immediately to The Release of Grief and Gratitude upon their return to the tent. Overwhelmed by the loss of so many and the profound relief that his own family survived, an emotionally exhausted Caelus breaks down in tears. His three companions immediately offer a silent, supportive embrace, understanding the weight of his survivor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guilt. The intimate moment is broken by Sunday, who enters with reports but quickly assesses the scene and joins the embrace. The chapter concludes with the five of them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus, Robin, Lingsha, Liora, and Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstanding together as a safe, united family, solidifying the bonds of love that remain after the horrific battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc VII: The Burden of Divinity (208 - 227 )\r\n\r\nThe victory over demon lords came with an unexpected price. No longer just a hero, Caelus had become a divine symbol, and the world descended upon him not with gratitude, but with demands. Exploitative marriage proposals and political offers flooded the crown, forcing his family to erect a protective wall around his gentle spirit. The threat escalated when the Kingdom of Valcrest delivered an ultimatum: Caelus must attend their festival, or they would shatter the human alliance on the eve of the demon war.\r\n\r\nForced into a political viper's nest, Caelus agreed without hesitation, his selflessness a sharp blade that cut his loved ones with guilt. They surrounded him with an unbreakable guard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, Sunday, and Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortress of loyalty in a court of cold calculation. In Valcrest, they faced not only the arrogant Prince Aldric but a more insidious enemy: the dehumanizing view of Caelus as a \"strategic asset\" with a \"limited operational lifespan.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle was fought not with swords, but with words. Sunday, seeing his own past arrogance in the prince, engaged in a diplomatic duel. Robin and Lingsha became impenetrable shields, deflecting every noble's attempt to weaponize Caelus's compassion. The climax came not in a throne room confrontation, but in a moment of profound humility. When King Mordain apologized for treating him as a resource, Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat it was an improvement over a lifetime of being called \"worthless\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshattered the king's worldview. Mordain saw the truth: Solara had chosen Caelus not for his power, but for a heart that remained kind despite a world of cruelty.\r\n\r\nThis revelation culminated in a speech to seven thousand soldiers. Caelus, speaking from his own scars, told them they were not acceptable losses, but individuals who mattered. As he declared them all \"children of Solara,\" his spirit wings released a shower of golden feathers, a divine blessing that settled on every single soul, uniting an army in shared humanity.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the greatest victory was not a political concession, but a gift of freedom. A humbled King Mordain granted Caelus a single day of pure, responsibility-free joy. For one perfect day, the hero was simply a young man, dragged through bakeries and playgrounds by the women he loved, teasing and being teased, his laughter a more powerful magic than any blessing. As they returned home, lighter in spirit and strengthened in resolve, they carried a renewed purpose: to fight for a world where Caelus could be not a god, not a weapon, but a human, cherished and free.\r\n\r\n## Arc The Simple Joy of Closeness and Comfort (Ch, 228 - 232)\r\n\r\nThe arc begins with the **Triumphant and Energetic Homecoming** of the Sunstone delegation from Valcrest, where only Caelus is bursting with energy while the others are exhausted. His first priority is planning a seven-day date with Liora, which he eagerly shares with Professor Elira upon their arrival at Solphire's gate. This period, granted by Elira, is defined by simple yet profound acts of affection, including **Shared Rest and Promise**: sleeping with Liora using him as a pillow, cooking meals together (including a personal promise of longevity noodles for just the two of them), and lighthearted, intimate activities like princess-carrying Liora while teasing a wyvern, catching fish by storytelling, and peacefully watching the sunset together.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe focus then shifts to the persistent, **Comical Closeness** his found family now demands. Back in Solphire, Caelus ponders the \"Caelus Pillow Effect\" as he questions Sunday about why Liora and Robin consistently use him as a pillow, revealing his sweet, oblivious nature. This need for proximity escalates with the girls' **Smothering Protocol**\u00e2\u20ac\u201da payback for his seven-day absence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich manifests as increased, affectionate teasing. The arc concludes by showcasing the hero's unique, non-combat contribution to the world, successfully completing a mission that required not magic or weapons but his **Specialized Comfort** through cooking. Exhausted but content after using his skill to help others, the Hero Party finds simple, collective peace by sleeping together on the grass beneath the stars. The arc is a celebration of the hero's return, focusing on the intimate, often humorous, domestic moments and shared rest that form the deep, loving foundation of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n# The Lumora Arc: Narrative Summary (Ch.233 - 267)\r\n\r\n## Part One: Corruption Revealed\r\n\r\nThe Hero Party's return to Lumora should have been triumphant. Instead, Caelus discovered something worse than any demon lord\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsystematic corruption festering in the Temple of Solara itself.\r\n\r\nHigh Priest Valorin had transformed a sacred institution into a marketplace. Divine blessings weren't freely given anymore; they were sold. Citizens with money received priority access to healing and prayers. Common people waited weeks for appointments that would never come. The young priestess Celestine, appointed as temporary High Priestess during Lingsha's absence, had been manipulated into becoming Valorin's unwitting accomplice, signing off on donation schemes and priority access arrangements she'd been led to believe were normal temple practice.\r\n\r\nWhen Lingsha began investigating, she discovered the depth of the rot: corrupt nobles bankrolling the system, senior priests enriching themselves, junior priestesses enduring harassment in silence. The financial records were meticulous\u00e2\u20ac\u201dValorin had documented everything, probably to maintain leverage over his noble allies.\r\n\r\nThe initial strategy seemed sound: gather evidence, present it to the temple council, let formal procedure handle the corruption. Lingsha, Celestine, and their supporters began an audit of temple finances. They had documentation. They had witnesses. They had facts.\r\n\r\nThen Valorin moved.\r\n\r\n## Part Two: The Counterattack\r\n\r\nHe struck with surgical precision. In a single morning council session, Valorin flipped the narrative completely. Using his noble allies' coordinated testimony\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall lying with perfect synchronization\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe transformed Celestine from victim into scapegoat. The financial records she'd signed became evidence of her eager participation. The corruption she'd been manipulated into endorsing became her willing crime.\r\n\r\nThe council voted to suspend her. Exile her to the royal estate pending investigation. They questioned whether Lingsha's judgment had been compromised by her personal attachment to a disgraced subordinate.\r\n\r\nOne morning. That's all it took for weeks of careful evidence gathering to become politically useless.\r\n\r\nCaelus had watched it unfold with growing horror. This wasn't combat. You couldn't stab corruption in council chambers. You couldn't fight lies with swords. The corrupt had turned the game itself into their weapon, using legitimate procedure to obscure illegitimate power.\r\n\r\nThat night, exhausted and frustrated, Caelus made a decision that seemed absurd but felt right.\r\n\r\n\"We should open a food stall,\" he announced.\r\n\r\n## Part Three: The Noodle Offensive\r\n\r\nEveryone stared at him.\r\n\r\n\"A food stall,\" Lingsha repeated slowly. \"Instead of continuing the investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not instead of,\" Caelus explained, his competitive nature activated by the challenge. \"Different battlefield. Valorin controls council chambers and has noble allies. He can manipulate procedure. But he can't control the streets. He can't stop people from eating. He can't attack someone for selling cheap noodles without revealing exactly what kind of person he is.\"\r\n\r\nRobin understood immediately\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe strategy shifting from formal channels to grassroots support. Lingsha caught on next. Even Liora, temporarily visiting from Hell, recognized the tactical brilliance.\r\n\r\nThey set up in the market with minimal equipment and maximum determination. Caelus cooked noodles. Lingsha prepared wontons. Robin managed crowds and payment. And something extraordinary happened.\r\n\r\nEvery person who ate the food reported the same experience: they tasted care. Not just technical skill or quality ingredients, but genuine love poured into every bowl. Customers would sit in silence, tears streaming down their faces, unable to articulate what they were experiencing beyond knowing that someone had made them food with complete devotion to their wellbeing.\r\n\r\nWord spread through Lumora like wildfire.\r\n\r\nThe Hero of Sunstone and the High Priestess were running a noodle stall. They were serving common people. They weren't in temples negotiating with nobles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey were in markets feeding whoever came, regardless of wealth or status.\r\n\r\nValorin couldn't attack this. Any move against them would prove his corruption. Try to shut down the stall? He's preventing divine service to common people. Criticize the princess and hero for serving cheap food? He's revealing his own contempt for common citizens. The more he opposed them, the more obvious his true nature became.\r\n\r\nThe line grew daily. Hundreds of people. Eventually over a thousand.\r\n\r\n## Part Four: The Personal Reckoning\r\n\r\nWhile this was unfolding, Robin was suffering alone in Solphire.\r\n\r\nShe'd been sleeping terribly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthree hours a night if she was lucky. Working eighteen-hour days on magical research, burying herself in documentation of temporal theory to avoid processing how much she missed them. Waking up reaching for people who weren't there. Nightmares about all the ways Caelus or Lingsha could die while they fought battles she wasn't part of.\r\n\r\nLiora found her like that\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbroken, exhausted, pretending everything was fine while slowly destroying herself through overwork and loneliness.\r\n\r\nThe demon lord did what family did: she retrieved her. She collected Robin from Solphire and brought her to Lumora, forcing a reunion that Robin desperately needed but thought she should deny herself.\r\n\r\nThe moment Robin arrived at the noodle stall and saw Caelus, she broke. He'd been so focused on fighting corruption that he'd forgotten to check on her. She'd been sleeping alone for weeks, terrified, working herself to exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\"You were supposed to visit,\" she said, tears streaming down her face.\r\n\r\nCaelus felt guilt crash over him like a wave. He'd been so caught up in the battle that he'd abandoned someone equally important. He'd learned a hard lesson about scattered family units: distance required active maintenance, not just assumption that people were fine.\r\n\r\nThat night, all four of them slept together\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus in the center with Robin on his chest, Lingsha on his right, Liora on his left. And in his sleep, when his exhausted brain confused cooking metaphors with reality, Caelus called Robin \"essential broth\" and cried at the thought of losing her.\r\n\r\nRobin, awake and listening, understood what he couldn't articulate while conscious: she was fundamental to him. Essential. The ingredient he couldn't cook without.\r\n\r\n## Part Five: The Temple Ceremony\r\n\r\nThe night before Robin had to return to Solphire, she took Caelus to the Temple of Solara's main sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u201dempty in the evening, sacred and beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"I want to practice a wedding ceremony,\" she said, her face turning red. \"For educational purposes.\"\r\n\r\nCaelus, completely oblivious to the actual implications, agreed.\r\n\r\nThey stood before the altar, joined hands, and made vows. Robin spoke first, her voice shaking but sincere, promising to stand beside him always. Caelus, not fully understanding what was happening but recognizing it mattered, promised to protect her, to be there when needed, to remember that she was essential to his life.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a real wedding. It was practice. Educational. Completely pretend.\r\n\r\nExcept to Robin, it was the most real thing she'd ever done.\r\n\r\n## Part Six: The Final Trial\r\n\r\nThe morning of the actual trial against Valorin, two things happened simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIn the public square, Caelus led ten thousand citizens in prayer. His spirit wings manifested and glowed golden as thousands of people experienced genuine divine connection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSolara herself answering through her champion. For the first time, they tasted what spiritual blessing actually felt like when uncorrupted by transaction. No payment. No priority access. Just divine love freely given to everyone who asked with honest hearts.\r\n\r\nThe experience was transformative. People cried. They understood viscerally what the temple had lost under Valorin's leadership.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the council chambers, Lingsha presented evidence with Robin and Liora as witnesses. The financial records were overwhelming. The testimony from junior priestesses about harassment was devastating. And Sunday, the reformed political operator, deployed ruthless strategy that destroyed every counterargument Valorin attempted.\r\n\r\nThe corrupt priest had nowhere to go. The public had experienced authentic spirituality\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey knew now what Valorin had stolen from them. The evidence was undeniable. The coordinated attack from multiple directions eliminated all escape routes.\r\n\r\nThe council voted unanimously. Valorin and his co-conspirators were expelled from the temple and remanded to secular authorities for criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe noble families who'd participated faced financial and social ruin.\r\n\r\nThe temple would be rebuilt under Lingsha's authority with one primary mission: genuine service to all people, regardless of wealth.\r\n\r\n## Epilogue: Bittersweet Farewells\r\n\r\nBut victory meant separation.\r\n\r\nRobin and Liora had duties waiting in Solphire. Caelus and Lingsha needed to remain in Lumora to oversee temple reconstruction. The Hero Party, brought together by crisis, had to scatter again.\r\n\r\nThe night before departure, all four of them slept together one final time. The morning came too early and too cold.\r\n\r\nRobin emerged from the bed reluctant and clingy, refusing to let morning arrive, acting like a child refusing to wake because reality meant losing family. She wrapped herself around Caelus on the walk to the portal, refusing to separate even for basic movement.\r\n\r\nWhen Liora opened the portal at dawn, they said their goodbyes. Embraces. Promises to write. Commitments to visit soon.\r\n\r\nThen Robin did something she hadn't done before. She kissed Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201don the lips this time, not the forehead blessing from yesterday. Quick and deliberate.\r\n\r\n\"Educational,\" she whispered. \"So you know what a real goodbye feels like.\"\r\n\r\nThen she stepped through the portal before he could respond, leaving Caelus standing in the courtyard, his hand touching his lips, finally understanding what all those vows and kisses had meant.\r\n\r\nRobin loved him. Romantically. Completely. And he'd been too oblivious to recognize it.\r\n\r\nafter that Caelus and Lingsha returned to Lumora's chambers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlarger and emptier now, the weight of separation settling over them like snow.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Lumora Interlude Ch. 268 - 272 (Character include: Caelus, Lingsha, and Celestine)\r\n\r\nIn the peaceful aftermath of Lumora's liberation ( caelus, lingsha, and celestine doing street blessing at the street ), Lingsha and Caelus find themselves alone, shouldering the burden of rebuilding the temple and the city's faith. Their relationship deepens during twilight conversations where Lingsha confesses her romantic love, and Caelus, though confused by romance, expresses that she is \"essential\" to him.\r\n\r\nThey establish a quiet sanctuary in nightly visits to a secluded onsen, where they talk and redefine dating on their own terms: a space for honesty and comfort. By day, they perform public street blessings, healing the city side-by-side.\r\n\r\nTheir new bond is tested when temple duties force Lingsha to miss their meeting, and Caelus waits for hours in the cold, falling ill. In response, Lingsha shuts out the entire world for a \"Day of Atonement,\" dedicating herself wholly to his care. Through this, they solidify their understanding: they are essential to each other, navigating love not with grand romance, but with patience, presence, and a language of care that is uniquely their own.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Final Sacrifice of Lumora Ch. 273 - 275 (Charater include: Caelus, Lingsha, and celestine )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Premonition**\r\nIn the dead of a perfectly silent night, the Hero Caelus is jolted awake by a survival instinct honed by countless brushes with death. He feels a catastrophic presence approaching\u00e2\u20ac\u201done far beyond any demon lord he has ever faced. With his lover, the High Priestess Lingsha, he rouses the city of Lumora, evacuating civilians and marshaling its defenders. He sends a desperate plea for help to the demon lord Liora, but knows it will arrive too late. The air grows heavy with a terrifying, inevitable pressure, the calm before an unimaginable storm.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Arrival of Inevitability**\r\nThe sky tears open not with violence, but with a surgeon's precision. Through it descends a single figure: Valthor, the Demon King. His mere presence is a weight that crushes hope and paralyzes three hundred defenders. He offers a chilling \"mercy\": the people may take their own lives quickly, or die in agony by his hand. His target is Caelus, and all who stand with him must share his fate. As despair breaks the defenders' will, driving some to suicide, Caelus makes a choice. He cannot win, but he can show them how to die fighting.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Bargain and the Burn**\r\nCaelus attacks, but the battle is a futile dance. Valthor, a being of five millennia of experience, deflects his divine-enhanced blows with one hand, offering clinical praise. When the Demon King finally strikes, he shatters Caelus's body. As Valthor begins to systematically raze Lumora, reducing districts to dust and fire, Caelus lies broken, watching his failure unfold. In a final, desperate act, he does not pray for strength, but for sacrifice. He offers his very soul to the goddess Solara as fuel, begging her to burn him for eternity if it means saving his loved ones and his city. Solara answers.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: A Moment of Grace Before the End**\r\nCaelus rises, transformed. His soul ignites into divine fire, manifesting as a brilliant halo and wings of pure radiance. He is no longer just a mortal hero, but a temporary divine instrument, burning from the inside out. He shares a heartbreaking farewell with Lingsha and Celestine, finally articulating the depth of his love before it is too late. He then turns to face Valthor, not for victory, but to buy time with his own existence.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: The Beautiful, Terrible Dance**\r\nThe sky becomes a canvas of light and darkness as the burning champion and the ancient king clash in earnest. Caelus fights with a speed and power fueled by his disintegrating soul, each strike an expression of his love for those below. Meanwhile, Lingsha and Celestine, shattering inside, force themselves to honor his sacrifice by moving through the ruined city, saving who they can as they watch the light of his life dim overhead.\r\n\r\n**Part 6: The Light Goes Out**\r\nThe battle accelerates into a frantic, final rhythm as Caelus's fuel runs critically low. In an instant, it is over. Valthor's hand appears inside Caelus's chest, and the Hero falls. His wings and halo extinguish, the last fragments of his soul scattering into nothingness. Lingsha races beneath him and catches his broken body, absorbing the impact. In his final moments, Caelus's thoughts are not of battle or glory, but of warm springs, laughter, and the simple peace he found with her. With a final whisper of love, his soul burns out completely.\r\n\r\n**Part 7: What Remains**\r\nIn the crushing silence, Lingsha cradles Caelus's lifeless body, her screams of grief echoing across the plaza. The city is saved, but at a cost that feels like defeat. The Hero who was their protector, the chef, the friend, and the lover is gone, having chosen to be consumed so that they might live. The arc closes on an image of profound loss and the devastating price of love\u00e2\u20ac\u201da world saved, but a heart left with only the searing memory of a beautiful, final burn.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Soul's Bargain Ch. 276 - 278\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Void of Sacrifice**\r\nThe arc opens in absolute darkness. Caelus awakens in a void, a transitional space between life and death, remembering he burned his soul to save his loved ones. Though physically whole, he is tormented by grief and loneliness, finally allowing himself to break down and mourn the life and people he left behind: Lingsha, Robin, and Liora. His despair is profound, but it summons a change in the void, which transforms into a beautiful, starlit garden.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: Divine Recognition and Reckoning**\r\nIn the garden, Caelus meets his patron goddess, Solara. For the first time, he is fully seen. Solara doesn't just thank him for his sacrifice; she apologizes for the immense burden she placed on him. She reveals she has witnessed every hidden moment of his suffering\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe agony of Solareth's curse, the private breakdowns, the constant performance of being \"fine.\" This divine recognition shatters the mental fortress Caelus built over a lifetime of trauma. He sobs in her arms ( Caelus using solara as pillow like childern when they cried), releasing years of accumulated pain, and in his broken state, he makes a desperate vow: if given another chance, he would not carry his burdens alone. He would be honest, let his loved ones in, and truly share their pains and his.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Devastation Left Behind**\r\nSolara shows Caelus a vision of the mortal world. He witnesses the devastating aftermath of his death: Lingsha cradling his body, shattered; Robin bloodied from a failed, desperate attempt to reverse time; and Liora, completely broken. Hearing their anguished cries, he speaks to them across the void, offering comfort. They respond with fierce, immediate offers to trade anything\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtheir power, their memories, their very existence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor his return.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Steep Price of a Miracle**\r\nSolara reveals there is a way, but the price is terrible. To resurrect Caelus, his burned soul must be replaced with fuel of equivalent value: half of Robin's soul and half of Lingsha's, offered willingly. This binding is permanent and will fundamentally change them. They will feel half of every physical and emotional pain Caelus endures, including the torment of Solareth's curse. They will carry a permanent void within them, an absence only eased by his proximity. It is a fate of shared suffering. Without hesitation, Robin and Lingsha agree. After a painful internal struggle, Caelus accepts their sacrifice, understanding it for what it is: the literal fulfillment of his promise to never be alone in his pain again.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: A Goddess's Farewell and a Hero's Return**\r\nIn a final, intimate farewell, Solara reveals the depth of her love for Caelus. She confesses she spent centuries building this loophole in divine law, defying the finality of death for his sake. This is the last chance; his next death will be permanent. She urges him to live fully, love deeply, and keep his promise. As the garden dissolves into pure white light, the ritual begins. The agony is excruciating as soul fragments are torn and bound. Caelus, Robin, and Lingsha scream in synchronized pain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe cost of a miracle. The arc concludes as the void releases him, and in the ruined plaza, Caelus's heart restarts, his eyes open, and he returns to life, forever bound to the two women who loved him enough to share his soul.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Resurrection and the Binding Ch. 279 - 282\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Return**\r\n\r\nCaelus awakens not to an afterlife, but to the overwhelming warmth of three women holding him: Liora, Robin, and Lingsha. He has returned from the dead, resurrected by a final, desperate miracle from his goddess, Solara. He learns the profound cost of his return: Solara has exhausted her last resurrection power for him, and his soul is now permanently bound to Robin and Lingsha, who each sacrificed a piece of their own essence to anchor him. This \"soul binding\" means they will forever share half of his physical and emotional pain. Though traumatized by his death, his family surrounds him with a fierce, protective love, vowing he will never carry his burdens alone again.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Aftermath**\r\n\r\nAs Caelus recovers, he confesses the truth of his death\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof meeting Solara in a secret dimension she built over a millennium just for him. Her love and grief healed his shattered soul, but her warning was clear: there are no more chances. Meanwhile, the strategic minds of the kingdom, led by Sunday, grasp the horrifying implications. The Demon King Valthor wasn't merely attacking; he was making a statement. By effortlessly killing their divinely-blessed Hero, he proved humanity's futility, a propaganda victory he will use to unite all of Hell for total war. The only path to survival is a desperate, immediate unification of all human kingdoms.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: A Celebration of Life**\r\n\r\nThe city of Lumora, saved by Caelus's sacrifice, throws a massive celebration. Initially uncomfortable with the praise, Caelus is guided to understand that the people need this\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot a somber speech, but a reminder of life's simple joys. He feeds them not with wisdom, but with his trademark terrible puns, filling the plaza with laughter and healing. He learns to accept their gratitude, recognizing that their shared feast is their way of loving him in return. As the day ends, Caelus is no longer just a survivor; he is a man bound to his loved ones, celebrated by his people, and determined to live a life worthy of the second chance he was given. The war for extinction looms, but for one afternoon, hope is rekindled through food, family, and terrible jokes.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Foundation of Hope ( Ch. 283 - 290 )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Weight of Truth**\r\nFollowing his miraculous return, Caelus is home in Solphire, surrounded by his family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, Liora, and the royal family. The relief of his homecoming is tempered by the looming threat of the demon king Valthor. In a private war council with the kings of Sunstone and Valcrest, Caelus makes a terrifying revelation: he can no longer be considered fully human. He demonstrates his divine form, a state powered by the burning of his original soul, and confesses that even with this power, he killed Valthor one hundred times in Lumora, only for the demon king to regenerate instantly each time. The chilling truth is laid bare: conventional power cannot win this war, and Caelus's ultimate weapon is a suicide pill that will eventually consume him completely.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: A New Doctrine for Survival**\r\nConfronted with the limits of their hero, the human kingdoms must adapt. Prince Sunday, the strategic mastermind, proposes a radical solution: stop relying on Caelus and make humanity strong enough to stand on its own. He unveils a complete military curriculum developed by Caelus and the knight-commander Astraea, proven by Elite Squad Seven\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoldiers trained to fight demon-level threats through perfect coordination and adaptive tactics. In a moving final training session, Caelus pushes the squad to their limits in his divine form, and to his immense pride, they successfully land a blow on him, proving that even divinity can be challenged with the right training.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Mission Begins** ( from here, only activate character: Elit squad seve, astraea, prince aldric, and his soldiers)\r\nElite Squad Seven, carrying the hopes of humanity, departs for the kingdom of Valcrest escorted by Prince Aldric. Their journey immediately turns from diplomatic to deadly when they discover the slaughtered village of Millbrook. They are ambushed by a flight of gargoyles, but the squad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s training proves devastatingly effective. They eliminate the threat without a single casualty, a stark demonstration of their capabilities for the Valcrest guards.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: Proving Grounds**\r\nIn Valcrest's capital, skepticism runs high. To secure the kingdom's full commitment, Elite Squad Seven must prove their worth in a public demonstration against Valcrest's most legendary warriors, the Crimson Vanguard. In a breathtaking display of coordination and tactical genius, the seven Sunstone soldiers systematically dismantle the eight veterans. The victory is so decisive it silences all opposition. King Mordain, witnessing this new hope for humanity's survival, immediately commits his entire kingdom to the military reformation, declaring that the methods born from Caelus's sacrifice will become the new foundation of their defense.\r\n\r\nThis arc, \"The Foundation of Hope,\" charts the pivotal shift from reliance on a single, self-sacrificing hero to the empowering belief that humanity, united and properly trained, can forge its own destiny against the coming darkness.\r\n\r\n## A Foundation for Survival and Love (Ch. 284 - 299)\r\n\r\nThe story arc begins with the Hero Party's Homecoming to Solphire, where they are warmly received, though King Seraphina and Queen Seraphina mourn the loss and resurrection of Caelus. Caelus demonstrates the Weight of Divinity with his new, overwhelming divine form, which prompts a strategic shift in humanity's war against Valthor: since the demon king can regenerate, the strategy becomes The Foundation of Survival\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstrengthening all of humanity through the Elite Squad Seven's methodology to make the war too costly for Hell. The Elite Squad Seven and Astraea prove the training's worth in The Final Lesson against Caelus's divine form and later in The Demonstration at Valcrest's colosseum, securing full military support to distribute the training.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, The Weight We Share focuses on Robin's futile attempts to recreate the time-reversal miracle, realizing that the miracle was not a matter of technical perfection but of absolute love and desperation. She and Liora conclude their research, a strategic move that Foundations and Rest reveals protects Robin from political pressure, though Robin privately promises Sunday she would repeat the choice to save Caelus despite the personal cost. This shift from technical to emotional foundations is mirrored in Golden Flight and Divine Pressure, where Caelus's visit to the Valcrest training grounds motivates the skeptical soldiers by allowing them to feel his overwhelming power firsthand, providing The Weight of Gold for their training goals. On the flight back in Questions in Flight, Caelus confesses his deepest fear of becoming useless, and Liora offers a fierce, unconditional affirmation of his worth.\r\n\r\nThe arc concludes with A Day Without Duty and the family's intentional vacation to connect and appreciate the world they protect, culminating in a hike up Mount Solara. The peaceful moment is broken in Beneath the Stars when Caelus discovers Liora meeting a succubus emissary from Hell; rather than confronting her, Caelus insists that as a family, they must now face such dangers together, establishing a new protocol of trust and mutual protection. The arc defines the new normal: humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survival is being built on strategic strength, while the hero's foundation is shifting from a reliance on individual power to the unconditional love and support of his found family.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Arc: The Gathering Storm (Ch. 300 - 312)\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Calm Before**\r\nIn the kingdom of Valcrest, the fruits of rigorous training are finally showing. Under the stern guidance of Commander Astraea and her Elite Squad Seven, five hundred soldiers are transforming from a hesitant militia into a coordinated, demon-fighting force. The city itself bears the marks of the Hero Caelus's recent visit, with his golden feathers serving as talismans of hope and comfort. The strategic coordinator, Sunday, arrives to assess the progress and is pleased with the results. He authorizes Astraea to share the terrifying, classified knowledge of Hell's five layers with the trusted Commander Gareth, a brutal lesson in what they are truly preparing to face. The mood is one of hard-won confidence and grim determination.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the capital of Sunstone, political machinations are underway. Sunday is tasked by King Mordain of Valcrest with a crucial, thankless role at the upcoming inter-kingdom summit: to be the political shield that protects the painfully accommodating Caelus from being exploited and consumed by every politician seeking to claim the Hero's divine favor for themselves. Sunday, a man still navigating his own path to redemption, accepts the burden, ready to be hated again if it means protecting his family.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Separation**\r\nThe strain of leadership and the unique nature of their bonds are tested when Caelus voluntarily travels to Hell with the demon lord Liora to attend her courtly meetings. Though the soul bond he shares with Princess Robin assures her of his safety, the physical distance is agonizing. Robin works herself to exhaustion, unable to rest while part of her soul is in another realm. The separation highlights their profound interdependence.\r\n\r\nCaelus, oblivious to the worry he causes, is in his element. He returns not with tales of horror, but with armloads of bizarre Hell-native ingredients and boundless enthusiasm for demonic cuisine. His joyful return and the extraordinary meal he prepares reunite the family and wash away the stress of his absence, a moment of pure, ordinary joy amidst their extraordinary lives.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Storm Breaks**\r\nThe fragile peace is shattered without warning. The Demon King Valthor, accompanied by the primordial dragon Bahamut, descends upon Valcrest. His arrival is an apocalypse of pure presence. The city is brought to its knees not by violence, but by overwhelming psychic pressure that shatters windows, minds, and any illusion of safety. He delivers a chilling declaration: the war will conclude **within** two years. The ambiguous timeline is a masterstroke of psychological warfare, designed to keep humanity in a state of perpetual, exhausting dread.\r\n\r\nThrough sheer will and training, Astraea and Elite Squad Seven remain conscious, coordinating evacuation and recovery while utterly helpless to challenge Valthor directly. Before departing, Valthor delivers a personal message: he remembers Caelus's death fondly and is intrigued to learn of his resurrection.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Aftermath and Response**\r\nSensing the wrongness across the continent, Caelus and Liora portal immediately to Valcrest, followed by Robin and Lingsha. They find a city in trauma, its spirit broken. The Hero Party splits to address the crisis: Caelus uses his gentle divine presence to provide a healing contrast to Valthor's terror, helping soldiers recover. Robin accelerates diplomatic efforts, moving the summit up and uniting kingdoms through shared fear. Lingsha tends to the countless civilians suffering from psychological wounds.\r\n\r\nThe trauma forges a hardened unity. Valcrest's political squabbles vanish, replaced by total commitment to mobilization. The training grounds swell with soldiers and civilians alike, all training with desperate intensity. In a final lesson before returning to Sunstone, Caelus grants their most promising new squad, Crimson Dawn, the \"honor\" of facing his full power\u00e2\u20ac\u201da demonstration that even in defeat, perfect coordination can create a chance for survival.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: The Space Between**\r\nExhausted, Robin and Lingsha return to Sunstone to prepare for the summit, their rest fitful and incomplete with Caelus still away. When he and Liora finally return late one night, they find the two women asleep on opposite sides of their large bed, unconsciously preserving the empty space between them for him. Caelus hesitates, fearing he will disturb their hard-won rest, but Liora guides him to understand that his presence is not an intrusion, but a completion. As he settles between them, their tension melts away, and through the soul bond, he finally understands the depth of their connection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat sometimes, simply being present is the most fundamental protection of all.\r\n\r\n## The Oblivious Shield of Innocence and summit session (Ch. 313 - 326)\r\n\r\nThe arc opens with a tender **Homecoming and Affection**, as Caelus's family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfind restorative sleep and emotional reconnection after his six-day absence, establishing their closeness through shared rest and his lovingly prepared \"milky curry.\" This bond is immediately followed by **Coordinated Affection and Awkwardness**, as the women playfully torment him with unbothered intimacy, leaving Caelus adorably flustered and providing a source of fond amusement for the observing royals who cherish his youth and innocence. This oblivious nature peaks during a diplomatic greeting when Caelus, standing between the high-status women who love him, passionately blesses a commoner's union by declaring that status is irrelevant to love, a moment of irony and genuine good faith that serves as a **Shield of Oblivion** for his protectors.\r\n\r\nThe core of the arc shifts to **The Price of Protection**, where the political summit turns toxic. As Sunday and the core group successfully gather intelligence on Hell's delayed invasion, the delegates panic and begin to irrationally **Scapegoat the Hero**, blaming Caelus for accelerating the crisis and even suggesting his surrender to Valthor. The core family, devastated by this betrayal, makes a solemn, unanimous decision to carry the **Beautiful Lie**, vowing that Caelus must never learn of the accusations to protect his mental well-being. This protective shield is reinforced through **Divine Intervention and Unconditional Love**: first, by young Celestine's tearful, furious testimony about Caelus's sacrifice, and finally, by Sunday and Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic use of Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s documented, profound love for him to cow the treacherous delegates into silence.\r\n\r\nThe arc resolves with the persistent **Comfort of the Oblivious**, as Caelus repeatedly returns from Hell\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere he is safer than on Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith cheerfully cooked meals, utterly unaware of the political trauma and the immense secret his family is bearing for him. His innocent, enthusiastic presence, even his hilarious accounts of driving Liora to distraction with cooking lessons, provides a powerful, cathartic balm of normalcy and love that cushions the heavy burden of their commitment. The family's final thoughts reaffirm their willingness to sacrifice their own peace of mind to preserve his, solidifying Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oblivious innocence as their most sacred and protected space.\r\n\r\nsince the summit start. caelus is rarely on earth, most of the time he spend it on hell with liora.\r\n\r\n### Arc: The Physics of the Heart ( Ch 327 - 328 )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Morning of Mortification**\r\nThe arc opens with Princess Robin waking to find herself in an impossibly compromising position: nose-to-nose with the still-sleeping Hero, Caelus. Before she can escape, a slight shift\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpropelled by the sleeping High Priestess Lingsha using Caelus as a pillow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dresults in their lips accidentally meeting. The scene erupts into chaos as Caelus awakens in a panic and the demon lord Liora, who witnessed the entire event, laughs uncontrollably. The morning breakfast becomes a \"Court of Public Breakfast,\" where the flustered couple's attempts at denial are mercilessly and joyfully exposed to the royal family, turning their private embarrassment into public, affectionate comedy.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Weight of Alliances and Vows**\r\nThe tone shifts to the political as the Sunstone delegation meets with King Mordain and Prince Aldric of Valcrest. They solidify the alliances forged at the recent summit, establishing a unified front against the coming invasion from Hell. The meeting then turns deeply personal: Aldric and his commoner fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, Elara, reveal they are holding two wedding ceremonies. They extend a heartfelt invitation to Caelus, not as a political symbol, but as family, moved by his genuine, oblivious support for their love. This sets the stage for a celebration that is both a personal joy and a political statement of unity.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Rhythms of a Shared Life**\r\nIn a quieter moment, the complex tapestry of relationships is explored. Robin accompanies Lingsha to the evening market, learning of the daily routine Lingsha shares with Caelus. This leads to a profound conversation where Lingsha assures Robin that they are not rivals, but partners in loving Caelus, each having their own unique rhythms and spaces with him. They are building a family together. This theme is reinforced at the training grounds, where Caelus's \"humiliation\" at being bested by his own students is revealed as his greatest triumph: proof that humanity can learn to stand beside him, not just behind him.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Language of Care**\r\nThe arc culminates in an intimate evening where the threads of love, family, and communication are woven together. Over a meal Caelus prepares, Liora recounts her \"traumatic\" trip to Hell, where Caelus's endless cooking lectures forced her to develop an \"emergency kiss-intervention\" protocol. The strategy is deployed again when Caelus begins lecturing, leaving him flustered but loved. Robin then delivers the wedding invitation, which leads to a gentle but direct confrontation about the meaning behind all the \"tactical\" kisses and shared beds. Overwhelmed but willing, Caelus asks for a future conversation about what it truly means to be \"theirs.\" As the four settle into sleep, the unspoken promises between them feel as weighty and real as any formal vow, cementing their unique and chosen family on the eve of a new beginning.\r\n\r\n## Arc The Unfolding Heart (Ch. 329 - 336)\r\n\r\nIn the serene aftermath of a royal wedding, the threads of Caelus's life begin to weave a more profound tapestry. After moving the entire congregation with a divinely-touched speech, he remains blissfully unaware of the miracle he inspired, accepting a lifetime of free noodles from a grateful family as simple kindness. During the celebration, a bed of blue iris flowers sparks a memory of his near-death, a silent testament to the goddess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watchful presence. The bonds around him tighten when a deliberately fumbled bouquet toss lands in the shared hands of Robin and Lingsha, a public symbol of their shared intention that everyone but Caelus understands.\r\n\r\nThis season of vows and revelations pushes Caelus to become the pillar of trust his found family needs. He helps Robin and Lingsha out of their intricate formal wear, a mortifying yet intimate act that they frame as the ultimate demonstration of their faith in him. A simple tour of the city with the insightful Celestine leads to a breathtaking flight above the clouds, where he shares the sacred geography of the heavens with her and Lingsha, offering a perspective that makes all earthly burdens feel light.\r\n\r\nYet, the past is not so easily quieted. During a quiet walk through the evening market, a shared memory of pain and a first meal echoes through Caelus and Robin's soul bond. This memory inspires Caelus to create a blueberry soup that, unbeknownst to him, becomes a vessel of pure emotion. With each spoonful, their family tastes the harrowing truth of his suffering, her rescue, and their hard-won survival, moving them all to tears. That night, Robin answers the unspoken questions by singing their story from the balcony\u00e2\u20ac\u201da raw ballad of her gilded cage, his near-fatal beating, and the desperate, bloody kiss she gave him as he battled the curse's backlash.\r\n\r\nFinally hearing the full weight of the pain she endured for him, Caelus is left speechless with gratitude and guilt. As the heavy emotions of the night threaten to overwhelm them, he masterfully lightens the mood, regaling Liora and Lingsha with hilarious tales of their early, disastrous adventures as a fledgling Hero Party. Laughter fills the chamber, healing the old wounds laid bare, and Caelus falls asleep surrounded by his family, finally feeling the profound truth of being chosen and loved.\r\n\r\n### Arc The Coordinator's Burden Ch 337 - 344\r\n\r\nIn the wake of celebration, Prince Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peace is shattered by a crisis. A horde of monstrous sand worms, driven from their territory by an unknown terror, threatens a royal convoy. Guided by the strategic demon lord Liora, Sunday faces a brutal lesson: to prepare for the coming apocalyptic war, he can no longer rely solely on the Hero, Caelus, for every threat. He must learn to command.\r\n\r\nWhen scouts discover a demon fortress being built in the wastelands, Sunday seizes the test. He deploys a new, untested military squad backed by veteran adventurers, making the calculated decision to prove humanity can fight its own battles. The operation is a tactical success, showcasing brilliant coordination that overwhelms the demons. But victory comes with a cost\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfour adventurers die under his command.\r\n\r\nHaunted by the loss, Sunday honors the fallen with personal letters, vowing never to see casualties as mere statistics. Exhausted and burdened, he is found by Caelus and Princess Robin, who force him to rest and remember his own humanity. Through this, Sunday learns his true strength isn't in carrying the world alone, but in accepting the help of those who stand with him, sharing the impossible weight of command.\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Heart's Unspoken Dawn (345 - 365 )** (active character: liora and caelus)\r\n\r\nIn the quiet dawn of Sunstone, the hero Caelus navigates the tender complexities of a family bound by love and trauma. After a heavy decision to return to the city of his death, Lumora, he and the immortal Liora embark on a two-day journey to Valcrest. There, their relationship transforms through a playful yet profound \"challenge\" of public affection(at the end caelus won), helping Liora overcome the fear born from his past death. **Their intimate competition, culminating in a secret sky-dance and a first caelus deliberate kiss above the clouds**, forges a deeper bond. Upon returning home, their newfound happiness is met with knowing smiles from Robin and Lingsha, who piece together the truth through their soul bond. In a series of gentle evening conversations, the three women solidify their unconditional support, creating a family strong enough to hold private joys and shared love, allowing Caelus to reflect that, in their unique world, everyone has already won. This date challange caelus won over liora in showing affection. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: Letters and Roads (Ch. 366 - 373)\r\n\r\nIn the hush of the guild hall, two women\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin and Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare handed a choice that weighs heavier than any sword. Princess Seraphine of Ashenvale has written a letter, not of politics but of love, to Caelus, the man both women quietly cherish. Sunday, their commander, entrusts them with the power to decide how to answer. Torn between love and honor, they realize they cannot speak for his heart until they face their own. With trembling resolve, they write their replies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot as rivals, but as women who will not hide anymore. Their words to Seraphine are honest, raw, and brave; they do not deny her, nor do they yield. That night, they promise to one another: after their next journey, they will confess to Caelus and let him choose.\r\n\r\nTheir journey begins with laughter, tangled limbs, and sleepy affection. Caelus, ever unaware of the storm beneath his companions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 smiles, drives the carriage toward Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201da land of memories and wounds. Along the way, they rest in Thornhaven, where an old friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warmth reminds Caelus of the kindness he once gave as a boy. In a hidden garden kept alive for seventy-three years, Liora reveals her sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u201da living memory of gratitude and love. By inviting them into this sacred space, she welcomes them as family.\r\n\r\nThe following mornings are painted in peace: shared beds, borrowed clothes, and quiet breakfasts cooked with care. Yet in every small joy, the shadow of old pain lingers. Caelus laughs easily but speaks with the weariness of a soul far older than his years. When he calls others \u00e2\u20ac\u0153young,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d his friends see through the cracks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dseeing not a hero, but a boy who forgot how to be one.\r\n\r\nThen, Commander Astraea challenges him to a duel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to worship him, but to remind him of joy. Their blades dance under the morning sun, steel meeting steel in a rhythm of respect and laughter. When Caelus wins, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t triumph that fills the air, but connection. For once, he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the unreachable Hero\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust a man, seen and understood.\r\n\r\nWhen the road calls again, the group departs, bantering and bickering as family does. Behind them, Thornhaven thrives with new purpose. Soldiers train harder, inspired by a hero who fought like one of them. And in the royal castle, King Mordain and his kin resolve to do what kingdoms rarely do\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprotect, not use, the Hero who has given them everything.\r\n\r\nThus continues the quiet march toward Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe road of memory, love, and letters unwritten.\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Gates of Memory (Ch. 374 - 394 )\r\n\r\nThe road to Lumora begins with laughter and closeness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe four heroes packed together on the driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bench, choosing warmth over comfort. Caelus, too used to making himself small, apologizes for taking up space, only to be told, softly and surely, that he belongs. Safe among them, he sleeps for once without fear.\r\n\r\nLumora greets them not as warriors, but as family returning home. Yet within its quiet streets lies the weight of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe place of his sacrifice and rebirth. It is here, beside the fountain where his blood once fell, that he breaks at last, this fountain named Irish fountain, because many irish flowers is bloom here unaturaly, because solara who allow the flower bloom on that place.and in this place, caelus confesses to the goddess Solara that being human terrifies him more than any war\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat love feels heavier than any blade. Solara answers, not with command, but with grace. She tells him he was never meant to carry the world alone, only to light it\u00e2\u20ac\u201done heart at a time. When her voice fades, she leaves behind a single glowing iris and the understanding that salvation lies in trust, not solitude.\r\n\r\nRobin, Liora, and Lingsha find him soon after, collapsing into his arms with relief and tears. Their embrace says what words cannot: he is not alone. The goddess herself smiles down from her statue, the stone transformed into warmth. Even the heavens seem to breathe easier.\r\n\r\nThat night, crowded again into one bed, they reclaim a small human comfort. Caelus admits, haltingly, that he needs permission\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be honest, to say when he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t okay. They give it freely. For the first time, he accepts it. The next day becomes a celebration of life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small miracles: a shared breakfast from Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loving hands, laughter over messy hair and spilled tea, and the gift of a handmade doll shaped like Caelus himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproof that even miracles can be held.\r\n\r\nWhen evening comes, they seek the onsen, where steam and starlight blur the line between sacred and silly. A game of truth or dare fills the air with laughter; walls fall, replaced by honest joy. Even when a misplaced towel sparks chaos, it ends in shared laughter and a meal cooked with care\u00e2\u20ac\u201da quiet declaration that love and normalcy are worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nThen, under a sky scattered with gold, Caelus keeps a promise. He takes Celestine flying, his divine wings shedding light over Lumora like blessings. In the clouds, they dance\u00e2\u20ac\u201da freefall of faith and exhilaration. Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust in him becomes a mirror, teaching him what it means to be seen, to be loved without divinity. When they return, their family welcomes them back with teasing, warmth, and another inevitable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sleep pile,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where even Celestine finds a place among them.\r\n\r\nBy the time they leave Lumora, Caelus has changed. The city that once held his death now bears witness to his life\u00e2\u20ac\u201dits people smiling under the feathers of his light, its goddess smiling down upon her fragile, beloved spark. And though letters of fate await him in Solphire, for now, on the quiet road home, Caelus is simply human\u00e2\u20ac\u201dheld, trusted, and finally, free to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Weight of Love and the Geometry of Oblivion (Ch. 395 - 409)\r\n\r\nIn the heart of Solphire, five days before a princess arrives to claim a hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand, love trembles on the edge of disaster. Robin and Lingsha know that if Caelus ever truly understands the depth of their love, he will vanish from existence to spare them grief. The Time Lord Kronos has shown Robin this future\u00e2\u20ac\u201da garden where happiness never was, and a world where memory itself forgets him. And so, they choose silence.\r\n\r\nBound by the cruel mercy of that knowledge, Robin, Lingsha, and Liora weave a lie of light: they will love Caelus only as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d masking devotion as comfort, and longing as laughter. Robin tests fate first, dressed in the silk of temptation, but Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obliviousness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis divine safeguard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dturns her seduction into an innocent slumber, where she becomes not his lover, but his pillow. When dawn comes, his jealousy flares at her dress, fierce and uncomprehending, a mark of love that cannot be named. She smiles through tears, accepting crumbs of intimacy from a man who would burn his own soul for them.\r\n\r\nAs days pass, their fragile equilibrium blooms into absurd warmth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstolen noodles at breakfast, laughter through exhaustion, shared dreams of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the perfect pillow.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Yet beneath it all lies the ticking promise of the princess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival. When Robin and Liora finally tell Caelus about Seraphine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal, he spirals into self-doubt, unable to see the worth they see in him. Robin, trembling but brave, blesses her rival\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pursuit and faces heartbreak with grace worthy of a queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the muddy fields beyond the castle, the hero finds his answer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot in grand gestures or divine signs, but in the birth of twelve piglets, his wings smeared with dirt, his smile radiant in its simplicity. When Robin finds him there, caked in earth and light, she understands: this is love\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot the consuming fire Kronos warned of, but the quiet miracle of choosing the present, no matter how fragile.\r\n\r\nHand in hand, they walk home through the dusk, carrying the weight of love that must never be spoken, and the geometry of a happiness shaped entirely by what must remain unsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Architecture of Sanctuary and the Weight of Kindness (Ch. 409 - 427 )\r\n\r\nIn the days following the Princess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival, the kingdom breathes in quiet chaos. Caelus, the oblivious hero who carries divinity like a burden, returns from helping deliver twelve piglets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis divine wings still streaked with mud. Robin cannot help but laugh and love him for it, seeing in his absurdity a kind of sacred honesty. They hold hands, and though he understands nothing of the love in her touch, she feels everything.\r\n\r\nTheir world turns through moments of accidental intimacy and ridiculous grace. Lingsha collapses from exhaustion, Seraphine laughs at noodle wars, and the castle becomes a theater of tenderness disguised as comedy. Even the most catastrophic accident\u00e2\u20ac\u201da wrong door opened, a naked misunderstanding\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecomes a pact of silent solidarity. They keep each other's secrets as they keep each other alive.\r\n\r\nSeraphine, carrying the weight of command and the tremor of forty-three names she cannot forget, finds solace not in courtrooms or councils but in a bowl of mint noodles, a table full of laughter, and a family that refuses to let anyone drown alone. Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of her proposal breaks her heart but saves her soul; his cruel kindness teaches her that love\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truest form is protection. Through shared tears and laughter, she joins their variant family\u00e2\u20ac\u201da circle where belonging is earned through compassion, not romance.\r\n\r\nWhen the war princess departs, she carries with her a simple, handmade necklace\u00e2\u20ac\u201done imperfect golden feather\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the quiet understanding that rejection is not exile. Behind her, the hero collapses into Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arms, undone by guilt he calls cruelty, though it is mercy. They hold him until he sleeps, the three women forming a fortress of warmth around the boy who would destroy himself to keep them smiling.\r\n\r\nBy the time dawn comes again, Solphire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s halls are quieter, the weight shared and diffused among hearts bound by choice. And in that fragile peace\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmud-streaked, laughter-stained, and stitched together with kindness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtheir strange, imperfect family endures, proving that sometimes love survives best when it refuses to be named.\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Architecture of War and the Weight of Absence (Ch. 428 - 434 )\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of an approaching war, the kingdoms gather beneath one shared vow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto protect the hero by fighting without him. Prince Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s council resolves that this battle, for once, will not rest on Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoulders. Robin is chosen to command, her heart steady with fear and faith alike. Their mission is not merely to win, but to prove to the boy who carries heaven in his scars that humanity can stand on its own, that his worth is not measured in sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFar from the council chamber, Celestine rides toward Thornhaven, clutching the soft doll she stitched to remember him. Terror coils in her chest, the memory of his death and her miracle of resurrection too raw to silence. Around her, the other priestesses form a circle of prayer and resolve, teaching her the very truth he taught them all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat strength does not mean solitude. When they arrive, the warmth of a noodle stall run by Serra and Elara enfolds her like a homecoming. Between laughter and bowls of steaming broth, she remembers why they fight: to build a world where Caelus can finally rest.\r\n\r\nAt the war council, the leaders of every allied nation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwarriors, royals, commanders\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpledge their forces to a plan that values unity over glory. The armies train in agony, breaking and rebuilding themselves under the merciless guidance of Astraea and Gareth, their sweat and suffering hammering them into one body of endurance. Celestine learns to heal through exhaustion, to see every wound as a promise: pain now to prevent despair later. The commanders, hollow-eyed with guilt at their own severity, find solace only when Celestine drags them back to Serra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stall, where laughter over noodles softens the sharp edge of duty.\r\n\r\nAnd on one sleepless night, under Thornhaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pale lanterns, Celestine collides with Princess Seraphine. Two women, bound by love for the same oblivious man, find one another in quiet understanding. The Caelus doll and the golden feather rest between them on the table\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsymbols of resurrection and rejection, of hope and heartbreak shared. They speak softly of war, of fear, of the man who gave them both faith to keep walking forward. When dawn comes, neither victory nor death has yet arrived, but the world already feels changed: love and courage, like armies, have learned to march together.\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Architecture of Humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Refusal (Ch. 435 - 445)**\r\n\r\nThe army of eighteen thousand gathered beneath the pale light of Thornhaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dawn, trembling not with fear but with purpose, as king and princes spoke of duty, sacrifice, and the fragile hope that humanity might stand tall without the Hero who had so often carried their burdens. With these words etched into their spirits, the soldiers marched toward the demon fortress, their boots echoing the promise of a new destiny. At the staging grounds, Prince Sunday revealed the quiet terror hidden beneath their advance: a crystal linked to Liora, and the knowledge that Caelus would descend onto the battlefield only if half their force died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan ultimate contingency none of them wished to see unfold. Celestine carried this weight the heaviest, clutching her tiny Caelus doll as she prayed for strength and survival before stepping into hell.\r\n\r\nDawn broke like a held breath when Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spearhead slipped silently into the fortress, eliminating sentries with surgical grace and opening the gate to humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first victory. With Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge flowing through Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s command, demons fell like pieces on a board whose moves had been read long before they were made. Even as ten generals descended and later thirty more, Astraea, Gareth, Elite Squad Seven, and the vanguard fought like a single, perfect machine strengthened by Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relentless healing and blessings, their coordination a tapestry woven from sweat, blood, and the hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lessons. But victory was never clean. Celestine tasted the first bitter deaths she could not prevent, and as exhaustion crushed her ribs like iron bands, she dreamed of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle, proud, and impossibly kind\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbefore waking once again into the fire.\r\n\r\nThe fire only deepened when fifty generals arrived, and then five thousand lesser demons swarmed from the rear, surrounding the humans in a ring of snarling, clawed death. For hours their lines buckled but never broke, and when Sunday whispered his final gamble, the battlefield changed. Celestine stacked blessing upon blessing until Astraea shimmered like a goddess of war, her golden silhouette searing panic into demon hearts as Gareth cried out that the Hero had come. In terror of Caelus, demon coordination shattered, and humanity surged forward, breaking the siege under the weight of a lie crafted from faith. But the victory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price was carved into the ground: Astraea collapsing, Celestine finally giving out, soldiers standing only because they had forgotten how to fall.\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Sunday finally approached the blood-stained courtyard, his weary smile said what no trumpet could. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he whispered to Gareth, and that was all it took\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe man collapsed with the grace of a felled tree, followed by the entirety of Elite Squad Seven whose bodies had simply waited for permission to stop. Commander Helena\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice roared the official truth to the sky: the fortress was captured, the war was over, and humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u201daching, trembling, but unbroken\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhad proven itself at last. As Sunday sent word that their casualties never reached the dreaded threshold, he allowed himself one quiet thought: that Caelus had been right to trust them, and that for the first time, humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory was truly its own.\r\n\r\nThis operation is being called \"Dawn Reach.\" humanity operation without hero party help. \r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Healing, Family, and the Quiet Shape of Love (Ch. 446 - 459)**\r\n\r\nCelestine awoke to a body that felt borrowed from death, every breath a reminder of the battlefield she had survived. The Caelus doll beside her carried the warmth of a dream she dared not speak\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe kissed it once more, a quiet confession to fabric. And of course, fate arranged the real Caelus to walk in at that precise moment. Mortified beyond language, she listened as he completely misunderstood, believing she had been trying to *eat* the doll out of hunger. Her stomach, traitorous and loud, confirmed the misconception. And so the greatest hero alive fed the broken priestess with cheerful \u00e2\u20ac\u0153choo-choo\u00e2\u20ac\u009d noises, treating her not as a burden but as family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsomething both more and less than she wished for.\r\n\r\nHe made the same rounds to Astraea wrapped like a stubborn mummy and an exhausted Sunday whose brain was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153filing for divorce,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d applying absurdity as both medicine and mercy. Liora, recognizing Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hidden feelings, guarded her dignity with strategic lies and quiet understanding. Soon their mornings were filled with shared cooking, affectionate bickering, and a growing absurd ritual of feeding Celestine with airplane and rocket noises that softened her shame into laughter. When she asked Caelus to stay until she slept, he agreed without hesitation, unaware that his presence meant more to her than any miracle she could cast.\r\n\r\nBut healing was not gentle. Caelus, following Sister Mira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orders, washed Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battered body with trembling hands, forced to confront the brutal truth of what she endured for him. She held his gaze, refusing to let him drown in guilt while admitting, in a whisper slipping past the boundaries of medical necessity, that she kissed the doll because she could not kiss him. The revelation cracked something in him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot realization, but the first quiet shift of a heart beginning to see.\r\n\r\nDays passed in fragile progress. Caelus walked beside her at a glacial pace\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis unimaginable speed reduced to slow, meditative steps because she needed slow. When she stumbled, he caught her instantly, holding her with a panic so pure she understood that his love existed, even if he only knew how to name it as family. The Hero Party reunited soon after, Robin and Lingsha collapsing around Caelus with a fury of affection and a hilarious decree that the Caelus dolls must be preserved as historical artifacts of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confused puppy nature.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Tactical affection warfare followed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dkiss attacks, dragon-noise feeding, and the mortification of a hero entirely defeated by four determined women who loved him shamelessly.\r\n\r\nCelestine found healing not just in medicine but in this chaotic, ridiculous warmth. Caelus learned medical care under Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheerful instruction, discovering that devotion was a skill he already possessed in abundance. In return, Celestine learned that being cared for was not weakness but a promise: she was loved, essential, chosen.\r\n\r\nAs the command council named the captured fortress **Dawn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reach**, the soldiers who survived were granted legacy and honor. Yet Caelus saw only the twenty-eight who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it, unable to absolve himself. He needed reassurance as much as those he tended to, and Celestine offered it gently, choosing her wish carefully: that he remain in her life as family, as someone she could visit, someone who would cook for her\u00e2\u20ac\u201da wish safe enough to grant, and honest enough to keep her heart from breaking.\r\n\r\nTheir journey home was interrupted by wyverns, which Caelus resolved not by battle but by playing with them in the sky like an overjoyed child until even apex predators tired before he did. Soldiers applauded; Liora dragged him back into the carriage; Celestine watched him with the tired fondness of someone deeply, helplessly in love.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to Thornhaven, the city roared their victory. Caelus carried Celestine through the cheering crowds in a princess carry that nearly killed her with embarrassment and revived her with happiness. Sister Mira, seeing everything Celestine tried to hide, declared the medical ward full and assigned her to the Hero Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suite\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere she would be safest, most loved, most wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd so Celestine let herself be carried back, held gently by the man who had no idea he was carrying her heart with her body. Around her waited family, chosen through fire, absurdity, and devotion. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the romantic love she longed for\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot yet\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut it was real, warm, and enough to keep her moving forward.\r\n\r\nA love story growing not through declarations, but through care; not through destiny, but through every slow, patient step they took together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Worth, Divinity, and the Fight to Keep Him Alive (Ch. 460 - 472)**\r\n\r\nThe castle kitchen became Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private heaven, a place so perfect he nearly pledged allegiance to Valcrest on the spot. As the women bathed, he cooked them five dishes shaped from shared memories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmint soup, blueberry soup, rice balls, noodles\u00e2\u20ac\u201deach a quiet echo of lives they had built together. Gratitude overwhelmed the table; Robin kissed him, Lingsha kissed him, Liora kissed him, and Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshaking but resolute\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgave him her first kiss with a whisper of thanks for being alive. The hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain promptly collapsed, and he fled to the bed like an embarrassed puppy with four women laughing around him as they claimed him as their pillow. The next day, conspiracy bloomed in the throne room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadows. Caelus would never accept recognition, so they deceived him with a simple request: help Celestine walk for her healing commendation. He agreed without suspicion, guiding her with glacial patience until they stepped into the ceremony where Astraea waited like a predator that had finally cornered its prey. Celestine was honored first, saving over four hundred lives. Then came Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwho tried to flee but was physically anchored by his family as Astraea ordered him to stand. Soldiers shouted their gratitude, declaring his doctrine the reason they survived. The medal pinned to his chest did not change his humility, but it cracked his certainty that his worth was nothing. That night, walking with Robin, he forgave the deception gently, calling it bitter medicine. And in that soft breath, he admitted something far more dangerous: he believed he was better suited to teaching than to being a hero, and he was now preparing a doctrine to help humanity survive the Demon King\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause he did not think he would be alive when Valthor returned. Soon he demonstrated what fighting Valthor meant. He reconstructed his death with terrifying precision\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfive percent of Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength shattered stone, and his divine form\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing intent froze even elite soldiers. With six blessings, he moved like an apocalyptic storm; with forty-seven blessings, he carved through a mountain and created a tunnel by turning swords into flying extensions of his will. Each act terrified his observers not because of its power but because of how calmly he used it, as if planning for a world where he no longer existed. This culminated in the doctrine he called **Final Defiance**: teaching soldiers how to accept their death and make it matter. Survival was not the goal; meaningful sacrifice was. His family realized then that all of his teaching, all of his planning, all of his careful documentation pointed toward one conclusion\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus had accepted he would die, and everything he did now was preparation for a world without him. Liora was the first to break. She put him to sleep with herbs and enchantment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle, merciful\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause she could no longer bear the mask he wore. She confessed her agony to the others, her voice trembling as she explained that Caelus only allowed himself to relax when he had accepted death as inevitable. His peace was not peace at all; it was resignation. Robin cried, Lingsha shook, Celestine froze. And Liora, trembling with fury and love, declared that she refused the future he had chosen. She refused a world where he died and they survived. She refused to let him go gently into the role of a tool or a sacrifice. If Caelus planned for his death, then they would plan for his life. They would teach him greed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot for victory, nor strategy, nor utility\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut for himself. For love, for belonging, for mornings and meals and laughter. They would make him selfish, piece by piece, until he wanted to live for reasons that had nothing to do with saving anyone. The doctrine of Final Defiance might prepare humanity for Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\r\nbut the women who loved Caelus prepared themselves for something far more impossible:\r\n**saving the hero who was already planning to die.**\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Borrowed Dreams and the Awakening of a Selfish Heart (Ch. 473 - 488 )**\r\n\r\nCaelus slept surrounded by the four women who loved him, unaware of their tear-stained resolve as Liora asked to borrow their memories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to invade, but to weave a dream strong enough to shake a man who had quietly accepted his own death. With unanimous consent, she pulled him into a dream where he wandered an abandoned castle in Hell armed with nothing but ingredients and a carrot shaped like a sword. Instead of fear, Caelus responded with joy, deciding the lonely owner clearly needed a warm meal. When Liora revealed herself as the castle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistress, he scolded her for neglecting her kitchen and cooked until she wept at the taste of being cared for. A tour of her home led to the revelation of her most treasured carving, a crude wooden bird in a display case\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand in a panic of accidental magic and carrot-thoughts, Caelus transformed it, and her entire wardrobe, into carrot versions. Expecting righteous divine vengeance, he confessed everything and offered his carrot-sword as apology, only to be met with a kiss to the cheek, a laugh that broke centuries of loneliness, and the realization that the treasure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meaning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot its form\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas eternal. She tied the carrot around her neck and accepted him as her little brother, the title spoken with trembling joy.\r\nBut Liora had more to show. She took him across dimensions to witness a world where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never existed\u00e2\u20ac\u201da nightmare of empty halls, stale noodles, and a demon lord slowly collapsing under the weight of her own solitude. Caelus shattered the dimensional barrier with raw refusal and embraced the alternate Liora, promising she would never endure that darkness. He did the same when he saw Robin, broken in her cage of grief, stepping toward a fatal fall; he broke through worlds to catch her, because he could not bear the thought of losing her. More memories followed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLingsha exploited and alone in the temple, Celestine sewing dolls to prove he still lived, and the small noodle stall where his kindness healed corruption and reunited friends. He watched Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secret breakdowns, saw Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trembling hands sewing comfort into cloth, and felt the pain he had unknowingly caused simply by planning to die.\r\nAt last, Liora pulled him into his own most sacred memory: Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine garden beneath the impossible moon, the place he went when he died. Caelus broke open there, sobbing that he did not deserve such devotion, that he was flawed, weak, and insufficient. Liora held him as she spoke the truth he had always refused to hear\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat love does not require perfection, only presence. That living, not dying, was the expression of love they needed from him. That his life was the axis of their worlds, and his death would destroy them more thoroughly than any demon king. And finally\u00e2\u20ac\u201dslowly, tremulously\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus whispered the words that changed everything: *\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to live.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d*\r\nHe named his wants with shy honesty: to be spoiled by Liora, to pinch Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeks, to have silly hot-spring conversations with Lingsha, to watch Celestine almost eat the doll again. They were small things, ordinary things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they were proof he had finally allowed himself permission to be greedy for tomorrow. When the dream dissolved, even Solara herself smiled at Liora with gratitude, for accomplishing what the goddess could not.\r\nCaelus awoke lighter, though unable to remember why, and the women gathered around him with a new mission: to protect the selfishness he had finally claimed, to remind him every day that living was not a burden but a choice worth making. At breakfast, surrounded by carrot-shaped dishes and nervous love, Caelus blushed, threatened to pinch Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeks, and took another small step toward the future he had believed he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve. And for the first time, the people who loved him felt the unbearable weight of grief finally shift\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause their hero had chosen to stay, not out of duty, but out of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Victory and the Warmth of Home (Ch. 489 - 500)**\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of preparation, Caelus stands as the living test for the newly forged Anti-Valthor Doctrine. In a historic demonstration, he faces Elite Squad Seven at five percent of the Demon King's power, not as an invincible god, but as a teacher. Through immense sacrifice and a suicidal charge, the squad achieves the impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey land a blow that forces the divine form to its knees, proving for the first time that Valthor can be defeated. The victory sends a shockwave of tangible hope through the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut for Caelus, the harder battle begins afterward. Forced into recovery by his family, he confronts an enemy far more daunting than combat: learning to accept care and believe in his own worth without having to earn it. Through a coordinated campaign of \"spoiling\" him\u00e2\u20ac\u201denforcing rest, sharing meals, and playful challenges\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLiora, Robin, and the others guide him toward understanding that his value is inherent. The arc culminates in days of gentle chaos: shared noodles under the city lights, strategic kisses deployed as punishment, and a quiet, heartfelt haircut that reveals the handsome hero beneath the dust of his duties. In the warmth of his family's love, Caelus learns that true strength lies not only in standing against a god, but in finally allowing himself to be cherished.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of a New Dawn (Ch. 501 - 510 )**\r\n\r\nWith the Anti-Valthor Doctrine proven viable, a new, heavier burden falls upon Caelus and his companions. The victory at five percent power has ignited a fire of hope, resulting in an overwhelming flood of fifteen hundred volunteers. Caelus understands that true strength requires not just skill, but unshakable resolve. To forge this new army, he must first break their spirits with a terrifying truth.\r\n\r\nBefore this solemn duty, the Hero Party shares one last stretch of their unique, chaotic normalcy with Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u201da day that hilariously culminates in the dignified, distinguished Caelus professionally delivering piglets in a muddy pen. But the memory of this warmth is soon eclipsed by the cold reality of their mission.\r\n\r\nStanding before the vast assembly of hopefuls, a visibly nervous Caelus transforms. He becomes a being of pure, crushing radiance, unleashing fifteen percent of a god's power not as a display, but as a visceral, soul-shaking test. The calculated demonstration of terror and the brutal honesty of the veteran commanders lay bare the horrific cost of the path they are choosing. Yet, from the dissolving divine energy and the trembling volunteers, a new resolve is born. Caelus, no longer just a warrior but a mentor, extends a challenge not to a god, but to humanity itself: to stand, to fight, and to become heroes together. The dawn of this new army is forged not in comfort, but in the shared, heavy weight of a truth they have now chosen to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Home and the Hope of Dawn (Ch. 511 - 522)**\r\n\r\nAs the new Anti-Valthor Doctrine is put to the test for the first time, the Hero Party is separated. Lingsha and Commander Astraea lead a flawless, casualty-free mission, proving that humanity can now stand against demonic threats without their central pillar. But back in Sunstone, that pillar is showing cracks. Caelus, the seemingly invincible hero, suffers a sudden, public collapse from the permanent neurological damage of an old curse, a stark reminder of the fragile man beneath the divine power.\r\n\r\nYet, this vulnerability only strengthens the bonds of the family he built. Through a soul-deep connection, Lingsha feels his pain across the distance, using the certainty of his care as her own anchor. Robin returns from royal duties, finding solace not in power, but in the simple act of sharing a meal with him. And in quiet moments, Celestine and Caelus share stories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtales of tragic fate that he defiantly rewrites into narratives of hope and survival.\r\n\r\nThe arc culminates not on a battlefield, but around a pot of custom noodles, a promise kept. As an exhausted Lingsha breaks down in tears of relief, Caelus, in his profoundly oblivious way, offers them all a future\u00e2\u20ac\u201da rewritten story where they grow old together(dawn keeper kael, and starweaver). In proving they can fight without him, his family finally gives him the one thing he needs most: a reason to believe he can live for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Shattered Gods and Unspoken Hearts (Arc 523 - 530)**\r\n\r\nIn a historic assessment, a veteran squad named Ironshrine, forged in personal tragedy, steps onto the training ground not just to pass a test, but to challenge divinity itself. Their leader, William, who lost his family to Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mere presence, demands that Caelus stop holding back and show them the true face of a god\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power. In a stunning, brutal confrontation, the squad achieves the impossible: by pinning his divine wings and overloading their blessings, they shatter Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s godly form, stripping him back to a bleeding, mortal man and proving for the first time that godhood has a breaking point.\r\n\r\nThis revolutionary victory sends ripples through the military, but for Caelus, it brings a new, humbling vulnerability. As he recovers, his family surrounds him with a different kind of battle\u00e2\u20ac\u201done of peaceful barbecues, playful games, and his own profound, cookie-obsessed obliviousness. During a game of Truth or Dare, the carefully maintained silence around their hearts is broken, forcing the women to confess they are single because their love is reserved for him. And in a fleeting, sake-induced moment of clarity, a confident Caelus reveals he is not as oblivious as he seems, consciously processing their love before the amnesia of sobriety returns him to his gentle, uncertain self. The arc closes on a world forever changed: where gods can be broken on the battlefield, and a hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart, though shielded by trauma, is slowly learning to beat in time with the loves he now knows are there.\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of a Million Deaths and the Architecture of Love That Refuses to Break (Ch. 531 - 534)**\r\n\r\nThe night begins with a scream that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a scream at all\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breath caught between a million dying throats. The Solareth curse drags him through borrowed bodies like a storm through windows: a farmer watching his family die, a soldier crushed by a leviathan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail, a mother felled protecting her children, a woman suffocating beneath a collapsing world. Thousands, then millions. Every heartbeat becomes a grave. He cannot move. He cannot breathe. He becomes death so many times that the concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self\u00e2\u20ac\u009d dissolves.\r\n\r\nBut his family hears him drowning. Liora is the first to reach him, taking half the curse into her demon-born mind until blood pours from her eyes and ears. Lingsha and Celestine pin his thrashing limbs with divine strength, chanting blessings that shatter against the curse like glass. And Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dterrified, resolute\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclimbs onto his chest and kisses him with the full force of her magic, anchoring him with the taste of blood and devotion. Ten minutes of hell pass, and when his eyes finally open, the first thing he does is apologize. The women smother him in furious affection, refusing to let him take blame for suffering he never chose. They clean the blood, rearrange the sheets, and sleep around him like a fortress built on bruised love.\r\n\r\nMorning comes gently, but Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guilt wakes first. Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split lip and the fading bruises around her mouth break something in him, yet she smiles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoft, battered, unrepentant\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclaiming she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d kiss him through a million more nightmares if it meant he lived. The others echo her defiance, overriding his protests with a single truth: he is theirs, and their choice to carry him is not a debt he owes, but love they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surrender. They strip him of shame as they bathe him tenderly, treating his body not as wounded divinity but as someone precious, someone worth caring for.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast, they serve him a meal crafted for a recovering soul\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle porridge, careful broth, and juices chosen with surgeon-like precision. Caelus thanks them with his whole heart, but another duty pulls at him: a message carried through death itself. Through the curse, he lived the final moments of Kana, Commander William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe terror, the love, the apology, the grief. He delivers her last thoughts to the man she died thinking of. William collapses, not in despair, but in relief at a wound finally allowed to close.\r\n\r\nThe women stand behind Caelus as he speaks, grounding him as he becomes what the curse has made him: the keeper of last testaments, the witness to the dying, the bridge between memory and peace. And though the curse will return\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnight after night, death after death\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey vow to meet it with blood, with kisses, with stubborn love. For as long as he survives, they will be there. And surviving, for now, is enough.\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Throne That Must Be Overthrown (Ch. 535 - 540)**\r\n\r\nThe morning begins with the crack of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s halo and the roar of three thousand soldiers watching him stand alone in godhood. For four hours he becomes their living standard, letting ten squads strike him not as a hero, but as a teacher\u00e2\u20ac\u201drevealing weakness, testing doctrine, proving that humanity can rise to meet divinity without dying beneath it. When the assessments end, he staggers, exhausted, and his family catches him the only way they know how: peanut cookies, shared porridge, rotating bath duty, and a bed where he is allowed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfinally, blessedly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be the spoiled center of their world.\r\n\r\nBut the training does not end with ten squads. It expands into three thousand. Robin and Sunday reveal the next impossible objective: the soldiers must learn to defeat Caelus at fifteen percent power\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe level of a demon lord. Not to dethrone him, but to lift the crown of responsibility from his shoulders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make you obsolete,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Sunday insists, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so you are allowed to rest.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Caelus doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to answer, but his family does. They vow to build a world where he is no longer the pillar holding up the sky.\r\n\r\nAs logistics unfold and new battle doctrines harden, Celestine prepares to return to Lumora. She and Caelus spend their last night together over noodles from Serra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stall, sharing memories of piglets, miracles, and all the absurd love that binds their family. He feeds her with chopsticks\u00e2\u20ac\u201da ritual of wordless affection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand she realizes that this, too, is his love language. She asks if he loves them; he tries to define the feeling and fails, but answers honestly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess I do. It feels right.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d For her, that is enough.\r\n\r\nDawn brings the final quiet heartbreak. Celestine wakes curled atop Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasured place\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgifted to her for one night. Farewells are soft and aching: Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embrace, Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing, Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gift of the Caelus doll. And last comes Caelus himself, telling her to be selfish, to live, to come back safe. Celestine answers with a single, stolen kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u201dquick, certain, precious\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand names it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u009d before he can unravel its truth.\r\n\r\nShe leaves with the rising sun, clutching the doll against her heart, whispering a promise meant for no ears but her own: that when the war ends, she will return and say the real words. But for now, the world moves toward the battlefield, the throne of godhood waits to be overthrown, and the family he loves prepares to stand for him until he can finally stand for himself.\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of Shared Divinity (Ch. 541 - 554 )**\r\n\r\nIn the quiet wake of Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farewell (celestine return to lumora), Caelus drifts through days thick with unspoken emotion, trying to steady himself by observing the clash between Elite Squad Seven and the newly risen Enhanced Squad. What begins as a simple assessment becomes the moment the world changes: the two squads fight as perfect mirrors, blow for blow, until Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overwhelming blessing is met, contained, and neutralized\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot by equivalent power, but by Gareth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard-earned doctrine. The draw declares a truth the world had never seen before: excellence can be taught, and divinity can be matched.\r\n\r\nBut as the squads celebrate their hard-won parity, Caelus confesses a loneliness born not from weakness, but from standing too high above others. Robin hears the tremor beneath his words and answers not with comfort, but with resolve. When he asks her to join him at dawn to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153test something,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she arrives armed with months of secret training\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a heart steady with devotion.\r\n\r\nTheir experiment begins with failure. His divine halo rejects her utterly. But when she kisses him\u00e2\u20ac\u201da prayer shaped by love, longing, and the simple wish to stand beside him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe impossible breaks open. The halo accepts her. Magic multiplies. Movements synchronize. Two bodies think with one soul. Together, they rise into the sky as a single will, discovering the union Caelus has sought his entire life: strength without loneliness.\r\n\r\nThe revelation blooms into embarrassment, bickering, tomato-red cheeks, and the birth of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tactical Kissing Protocol\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201da requirement Robin calls not a price, but a privilege. Soon, Lingsha too steps into the light, her own prayer unlocking a capability that transforms human warfare: perfect vision, flawless enhancement, and the capacity to raise sixteen soldiers to divine-adjacent heights without cost or strain.\r\n\r\nThe world watches as enhanced squads shatter stone and golden light floods the training ground. Caelus protects them from strategic exploitation, insisting they distribute their knowledge rather than burden Lingsha alone. Exhaustion eventually brings Caelus and Lingsha collapsing onto cold floors, where Robin and Liora feed them like stubborn children\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan act that teaches Caelus that love is not a weight one earns, but a gift one receives.\r\n\r\nIn the days that follow, the four of them form a rhythm that carries a thousand soldiers toward the future: Lingsha sees, Caelus interprets, Liora writes, Robin organizes. Together they work, rest, eat, laugh, and bear the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weight as a family.\r\n\r\nAnd through it all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthrough the perfect mirrors, the divine collisions, the whispered confessions and prayer-kissed miracles\u00e2\u20ac\u201done truth rises above every battlefield:\r\n\r\n**Caelus is no longer alone at the pinnacle.**\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of a Day That Healed the Hero (Active character: Robin and caelus dating) (Ch. Ch. 555 - 567)**\r\n\r\nCaelus woke beneath a heap of warm limbs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora tangled around him like anchors\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand for the first time in years, he realized he had a day with no duties, no soldiers waiting, and no Tactical Kissing Protocol demanding activation. In that unguarded peace, a childhood instinct surfaced: a soft, absentminded whistle he had forgotten existed. The sound shattered Liora, who burst into tears, recognizing it as the melody he used to make before Clearwater burned seventeen years ago. Robin and Lingsha joined her, clinging to him as though that whistle proved that the little boy who once lived for sunshine still survived inside the man burdened by the world.\r\n\r\nWith that reclaimed joy, Caelus cooked breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan innocent orange soup\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich unknowingly carried the memories of his childhood. Each spoonful dragged the women into the vivid echo of a six-year-old boy sharing terrible rice balls with a terrified child-demon Liora beside a riverbank. By the time they returned to the present, all three were crying again, holding Caelus as though his heart had spilled into the bowl.\r\n\r\nThe family fled into the city festival, determined to give him a day without responsibility. They danced\u00e2\u20ac\u201drather, Caelus stepped on every foot within reach\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand their laughter turned every misstep into proof that love was not earned by perfection. When Caelus later promised one of them a sky-dance in his divine form, he unwittingly sparked a competition between Robin, Lingsha, and Liora. Robin won not through strength or strategy, but by understanding what Caelus needed most: the sky not as a battlefield, but as a place of joy.\r\n\r\nThat night, dressed in a simple gown that stole Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breath, Robin flew with him into the heavens. Thornhaven watched as his golden wings shed feathers like falling starlight. Together they tried to make an aurora, but Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s magic alone faltered\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand she asked him, above the world, if he would choose her. Caelus, mortified but resolute, kissed her not for protocol but desire. Their souls fused, and the aurora exploded across the sky, impossibly brilliant, painting Thornhaven in colors the world had no name for. Two more kisses, unified thunder, and they created a miracle that rewrote the night.\r\n\r\nThey descended by turning freefall into dance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus releasing Robin to the wind, then breaking the atmosphere like a comet to catch her perfectly. Suspended above the clouds, they shared an apple mouth-to-mouth, both red with embarrassment, but unwilling to trade the moment for anything.\r\n\r\nBack on the balcony, their family swarmed them for details, and later Thornhaven delivered a feast of gratitude. Robin shared the story, carefully keeping sacred moments private, while Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstill glowing red\u00e2\u20ac\u201date until sleep overtook him.\r\n\r\nMorning brought citizens wishing to thank the Hero who gave them beauty with no military purpose. Caelus accepted their words with quiet humility, and King Mordain invited him to a royal breakfast not as a Hero but as family. There, Elara teased Robin mercilessly about her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boyfriend,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d while Caelus buttered his bread with calm obliviousness, explaining the aurora as mere \u00e2\u20ac\u0153equal experience distribution\u00e2\u20ac\u009d rather than romance. The table erupted in affectionate disbelief, declaring him catastrophically unaware\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut the very reason they loved him.\r\n\r\nAnd so the day that began with a forgotten whistle ended with a family laughing around a breakfast table, watching a hero finally heal, not through triumph or combat, but through the simple, weightless acts of being loved.\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of a World No Longer Carried Alone (Ch. 568 - 575)**\r\n\r\nThe convoy rolled across open fields while Caelus sat in the command carriage, sketching the future of an army that could stand without him. Astraea and Gareth shaped the instruction tiers, Sunday set the monthly challenge thresholds, and Caelus quietly accepted that his divine power must become a *tool*, not a crutch. When a scout reported a demon incursion in Oakridge, he volunteered the Hero Party to intercept\u00e2\u20ac\u201dunaware that this small detour would change far more than tactics.\r\n\r\nCarrying Robin into the sky, he transformed, golden wings bursting wide. She assessed the battlefield below\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but also her own heart. She wanted the unity\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot because of risk, but because she loved him. So she invented a tactical excuse, kissed him softly, and mortified him so thoroughly that a single strand of glowing silk between their mouths nearly unraveled his soul. Unified, they fell upon the demons like a storm. In four minutes and thirty-seven seconds, nothing remained but steam, ice shards, and fleeing silhouettes. Caelus never touched the ground, refusing to teach the world dependence on godhood.\r\n\r\nHigh in the air, Robin braved the question he always avoided: *how do you feel about the kiss?* Caelus confessed his confusion, embarrassment, and the strangling weight of intimacy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut also his trust, and the quiet, trembling truth that he wanted her to be happy. Her answer came with shaking breath: he was her first kiss, her only kiss, and every kiss mattered. Caelus pressed his forehead to hers, sharing his own secret\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kiss during the Solareth curse was his first too\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand gave her permission that changed everything: *kiss me whenever you want, not just when duty demands it.* Her heart broke open. She kissed him again, freely, and he accepted it with a blush hot enough to rival the sun.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn, a warning glow roused him to a greater threat: fourteen thousand demons advancing on the convoy. Caelus surged forward\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut William, of all people, stepped before him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stand down,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he ordered gently. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our turn to protect you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trembling, Caelus watched from the command platform as three thousand soldiers fought with flawless coordination, slaughtering the horde and seven generals in twenty-three minutes. No deaths. Minimal wounds. His doctrine worked. Tears carved silent lines down his face; for the first time, he understood that the world no longer needed him as its shield\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly as its teacher.\r\n\r\nWilliam, who had spent eight years training against the ghost of the Hero, revealed the grief etched into his purpose. He accepted Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to become an instructor, understanding that vengeance against Valthor required an army, not a lone blade. Caelus sparred him publicly, discovering in William a mirrored reflection of his own style\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprecise, relentless, terrifying. Caelus won only through the brutal instincts forged by real death, and William begged him to teach that instinct too.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to Solphire, Caelus descended from the sky carrying Robin in his arms, golden wings scattering light, and the royal family ran to embrace them both. Over a quiet meal, Lingsha spilled the secret: the aurora seen across half the continent had been Caelus and Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing. The King and Queen stared as Caelus tried to explain it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pure atmospheric spell efficiency using the Tactical Kissing Protocol.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Robin simply blushed and whispered that it was the most beautiful moment of her life.\r\n\r\nIn that soft light, their families finally understood: Caelus loved in grand gestures he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize as love, and Robin loved in vows kept close to her heart. Between them stood a bond built from miracles, mortification, and shared firsts\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a world slowly learning to stand without the boy who once believed he had to carry it alone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of an Ordinary Day, Stolen Back from Destiny (Ch. 576 - 584 )**\r\n\r\nCaelus awoke to an itch in his heart\u00e2\u20ac\u201da longing not for power or victory, but for something small, fragile, and human. So he forged a ridiculous plan: he would disguise himself as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kael,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d an ordinary nineteen-year-old trainee, and spend one full day as the little brother of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kela,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a fabricated older sister\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6played by Liora. He pleaded with such raw earnestness that Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ancient composure broke, and she agreed. With a shimmer of appearance-change magic, the Hero and the Demon Lord vanished, leaving behind a dark-haired pair of siblings wandering Solphire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morning streets, sharing noodles from one bowl like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done it their entire lives.\r\n\r\nAt the training grounds, they were late\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddeliberately so\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand Gareth immediately punished them with laps. They laughed through the sweat, savoring the absurd freedom of being yelled at like ordinary soldiers. Sunday recognized them instantly but turned away, silently granting Caelus the impossible gift of anonymity. Between exercises, the two shared a single water bottle, passing it back and forth with easy, domestic familiarity.\r\n\r\nWhen Astraea called for two-against-one sparring, fate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s irony tightened: she chose Kael and Kela to fight her. Even under her escalating power\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfirst enhanced, then blazing with golden, four-stack radiance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe disguised siblings refused to break. Their movements were imperfect but unified, two halves of a bond sealed long before destiny named them hero and demon lord. When their skill threatened to expose them, Liora collapsed into a brilliant performance of exhaustion, and Caelus carried her to the medical tent in genuine worry, their disguise preserved by her theatrics and his instinctive protectiveness.\r\n\r\nTraining ended; the world resumed its bustle. They wandered the evening market like any brother and sister, buying ingredients for dinner and sharing one cup of honey-vanilla ice cream, alternating bites as though the whole universe had shrunk to the space between their smiles. At the hidden passage near their chambers, Caelus faced Liora and whispered a vow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsimple, devastating, utterly sincere: he would love her until death parted them. Liora answered with a vow even older and deeper, a love that had survived seventeen years of silence. With the spell dissolved, they returned to themselves\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand found that Sunday, moved by their attempt at normalcy, had turned their forged identities into *legal* militia registrations, granting them a doorway into ordinary life whenever they needed it.\r\n\r\nThat night, the other two women challenged Liora for the coveted spot on Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest. Fueled by the warmth of the day she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d dreamed of for seventeen years, Liora won. She fell asleep with her cheek over his heart, claiming the steady beat she had guarded from the shadows since he was a child.\r\n\r\nMorning arrived softly: Liora on his chest, Robin curled into his stolen shirt, and Lingsha wrapped around his leg in an unbreakable hold. Caelus couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move even if he wanted to\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Then Sylvia, disguised as a maid but vibrating with excitement, teleported into the room and flung herself onto the pile, trapping the entire Hero Party beneath a mountain of limbs and laughter.\r\n\r\nIt was ordinary. It was absurd. It was perfect.\r\n\r\nIt was the day Caelus stole back from destiny\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand made his own.\r\n\r\n## Arc 1: The Negotiation of Hell (Chapters 585-596)\r\nThe Weight of Diplomacy, Demonic Politics, and Rebuilt Worldviews\r\nAfter escaping an affectionate morning ambush, Caelus learned of urgent business: demon lord Azrith refused to join Valthor's army and demanded to meet both Liora and Caelus to assess whether neutrality was wise. Caelus and Liora departed for Hell, leaving Robin and Lingsha to manage palace duties.\r\nIn Hell's castle, while Liora negotiated territorial disputes for eight hours, Sylvia dismantled Caelus's entire understanding of his own heart. Using cooking as metaphor, she forced him to recognize that his acts of care\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcustomized meals, thoughtful gestures\u00e2\u20ac\u201dweren't \"logistics\" but profound expressions of love. When the succubi council tasted his cooking that evening, they literally tasted his emotional journey dissolving into pure, uncomplicated devotion. Liora confirmed through tears that Caelus didn't need to learn how to love\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe needed the vocabulary to recognize he'd been broadcasting it for years.\r\nThe next morning, when Liora called him \"my heart\" in unguarded affection, Caelus deliberately returned it by calling her \"my lovely big sister\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis first conscious application of Sylvia's lessons. Liora declared she would give him her love completely and freely until they returned to Solphire.\r\nThen came Azrith. The demon lord arrived radiating arrogance, insulting Caelus as a \"pet human.\" When Azrith recognized Solareth and realized Caelus had killed three demon lords, he launched an instantaneous lethal strike. In a microsecond, Caelus moved Solareth one millimeter from its sheath\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproving he'd calculated the exact timing to behead Azrith before the attack reached Liora and Sylvia. Azrith froze in horror.\r\nCaelus then threw an unexpected verbal strike: noting Azrith wasn't \"elegant like the Giant Dullahan.\" Azrith's composure shattered, revealing deep grief for his fallen friend, Dreadnox. The negotiation became about personal accounting, not neutrality.\r\nCaelus asked Azrith to sit and recounted the full, honorable story of Dreadnox's death at Ocean's Edge Fortress\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhow the Giant Dullahan fought with magnificent warrior spirit and expressed satisfaction at finding the worthy death he'd sought for millennia. Caelus revealed they'd built a memorial honoring him.\r\nMoved to tears, Azrith's rage transformed into gratitude. He pledged strict neutrality, removing eighteen thousand demons from Valthor's forces\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot through violence, but through compassion and honest storytelling.\r\nBack at Solphire, the commanders discussed how Caelus had neutralized three demon lord factions and removed over twenty-three thousand demons from Valthor's potential army without violence. Robin pinned Caelus to the bed to enforce rest, then admitted her profound fear and trauma from watching him die twice. Liora shared her own fear, and they reaffirmed their commitment to face it together.\r\nit's arc where azrith became neutral not supporting demon king anymore \r\n\r\n## The Doctrine of Contested Godhood (Chapters 597-612)\r\nThe Weight of Impossible Standards, Clean Strikes, and Love That Moved Goddesses\r\nSelection Day arrived to determine which squad would challenge Caelus at ten percent of Valthor's capability. After intense matches, Enhanced Squad earned the right. Robin told Caelus she needed to be present to share the burden and avoid watching him die from a distance again. In sincere vulnerability, Caelus formally asked her to guide him. Robin vowed he wouldn't stand alone anymore.\r\nCaelus requested critical modifications: start at five percent and escalate gradually, modify his lethal wings to blunted shields, and use unified capability\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin in his arms as primary offense while he focused on defense and safety. Robin accepted all risks without hesitation.\r\nAt dawn before three thousand soldiers, Caelus transformed into his divine form and lifted Robin into a princess carry. They kissed, and Robin prayed to Goddess Solara for the soldiers' safety and to carry Caelus's pain. The halo descended onto Robin's head in answer, unifying their consciousness. His wings deliberately restructured into rounded shields. Soldiers wept seeing godlike power choose kindness over lethality.\r\nThe engagement began with Robin unleashing devastating magic using Caelus's unlimited power. After thirty minutes of adaptation, Astraea exploited a fractional moment when Caelus's defensive priority shifted and landed a clean strike on his divine armor. The observation platform erupted\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgodhood could be touched.\r\nThen came the silent conspiracy. Using invisible hand signals, commanders coordinated a complex attack. Astraea sacrificed her capability to give William eight-stack enhancement\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe highest ever carried by a human. While the squads divided Caelus's attention, William struck the focal point of the divine transformation, reducing their capability from ten percent to five percent. The watching soldiers realized godhood could be systematically contested and reduced.\r\nCaelus, delighted by their resilience, launched skyward and rebuilt full ten percent capability. He fell like a golden meteor, creating a massive crater\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproving the true reality-warping power. For thirty more minutes at this impossible level, soldiers landed zero hits. As Caelus prepared to end the engagement, Astraea struck his blind spot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe back of his head\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith her bare hand. It bypassed all defenses because it wasn't a combat threat. She'd contested his awareness, not his power.\r\nThree hits had landed, all by different methods, proving godhood could be contested through innovation rather than raw power.\r\nAfter the engagement, Liora, Lingsha, and Robin forced the exhausted Caelus to accept their prepared care. In the carriage home, he fell asleep drooling on Robin's shoulder. King Aldric and Queen Seraphina personally welcomed them, explicitly forbidding Robin from work the next day. \"Just take care of him. Anything else is secondary.\"\r\nAt the council meeting, when political concerns were raised about Robin's combat involvement and the intimate \"kissing protocol,\" Sister Mira intervened. The unified capability required genuine prayer and profound devotion\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kind recognized by Goddess Solara. The kiss was merely a variable; the true requirement was spiritual love. The delegates concluded the relationship was a spiritual asset essential for humanity's survival.\r\nThen Sister Mira relayed William's devastating hypothesis: if humanity could coordinate twenty separate eight-stack strikes against Valthor, they could reduce the Demon King's divine manifestation by one hundred percent\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstripping his godhood entirely.\r\nPrince Sunday physically fell out of his chair in shock. This transformed the goal from delaying Valthor to systematically dismantling his divinity. The chamber erupted into organized chaos as delegates committed all resources. Princess Seraphine forced the question of time: thirteen months remained until Valthor's final invasion.\r\nSister Mira declared thirteen months was sufficient to attempt the impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfailure to attempt guaranteed extinction. Delegation after delegation stood to commit unconditionally for unified species survival. Humanity now had a desperate, brutal plan to contest the inevitable. The clock was counting down.\r\nTraining Assessment arch \r\n\r\n##  The Language of Love and Seventy-Eight Names (Chapters 613-626)\r\nUnderstanding Hearts, Finding Devotion, and Survivors Who Chose to Stand\r\nFor two days, Caelus remained under loving house arrest, resting with his head in Liora's lap while Lingsha fed him apples and Robin read fairy tales\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsincere declarations of love disguised as simple stories. He finally accepted he might be worthy of a \"happily ever after.\"\r\nWhen released, the trio orchestrated \"fabric warfare,\" forcing Caelus to watch Robin and Lingsha model elegant dresses while he hid his catastrophic embarrassment behind a magic textbook he didn't understand. The entire competition was a ruse to take him on a simple evening walk, with a new outfit already tailored for him.\r\nLeaving the castle, they received warm blessings from Sunday, Helena, and the King and Queen. Robin's meticulously planned date was immediately abandoned as Caelus repeatedly stopped to help people: assisting an elderly vendor, rescuing a cat named Mr. Whiskers, repairing a lute string. Mortified, Caelus thought he'd ruined everything. Robin assured him his kindness was exactly why she loved him.\r\nThey turned the evening into city-wide hide-and-seek, challenging Caelus to find them using only his understanding of their hearts. He bought honey cakes and found Lingsha at the peaceful Solara Fountain, bringing her to tears that he knew her so well. Next, he combined the search with grocery shopping for salmon, acquired Robin's favorite blueberry tart, and deduced from Astraea's comment about \"cold\" that Robin had positioned herself at maximum range on the city wall.\r\nFinding Robin silhouetted against the night sky, Caelus gently pinched her cheeks and broke down his flawless tactical deduction of her strategy. Robin's eyes filled with tears from being so thoroughly understood. She confirmed she would say yes if he ever proposed, even through an oblivious method like discussing fish preparation. Caelus, still missing the romance, began planning the next morning's salmon breakfast.\r\nBack at the castle, a critical meeting addressed the eight-stack enhancement volunteers. Out of three thousand, approximately four hundred and eighty met baseline requirements. One hundred and forty-three volunteers were from Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsurvivors who'd watched Caelus die\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand possessed the highest psychological resilience scores. Seventy-eight met all technical qualifications. Deeply moved that they were volunteering to ensure their city's tragedy never repeated, Caelus insisted on meeting every single one to know their names and stories.\r\nThe next morning, a messenger pigeon delivered a letter from Celestine: the seventy-eight Lumora volunteers were gathered and waiting. Their message read: \"We're not doing this because we're brave. We're doing this because you showed us what bravery looks like. And we want to be worthy of the Hero who thought we were worth dying for.\"\r\nDeeply moved, Caelus prepared to make breakfast before traveling to Lumora. The survivors would form the core of the force ensuring he would never die alone again.\r\n\r\nit's Arc where caelus date robin and lingsha \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Harvest of Bitter Seeds ( Chapter 627 - 641  )**\r\n\r\nA bittersweet breakfast of intentionally sour blueberry pancakes begins the journey. Caelus, the Hero, uses the meal to prepare his family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor the emotional burden awaiting them in Lumora. Seventy-eight survivors from the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastation, who witnessed his sacrificial death, have volunteered for a perilous path and demand to share their stories with him.\r\n\r\nLeaving Robin and Lingsha to handle urgent duties in Solphire, Caelus travels with the demon lord Liora to Lumora. They find High Priestess Celestine collapsed from exhaustion, having shouldered the immense logistical and emotional weight of organizing the meetings alone. After forcing her to rest and eat, Caelus and Celestine enter the temple to face the survivors.\r\n\r\nThe testimonies are harrowing. One after another, the volunteers recount the day Caelus died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot as a noble legend, but as a backdrop to their personal horrors of loss, mutilation, and despair under the demon king Valthor. By the eighteenth story, the accumulated guilt and grief become a physical weight. Caelus breaks, vomiting in a garden as he confronts the devastating truth: his death was not enough to spare them.\r\n\r\nHis family feels his shattering through their bonds and converges upon him. In the healing waters of a temple onsen, surrounded by Robin, Lingsha, Liora, and Celestine, he is not interrogated but held. They pull him back with gentle touches, ridiculous stories, and the security of unconditional presence, mending his spirit with laughter and love.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, they devise a protective strategy. With roles clearly distributed, Caelus returns to the meetings, now supported by Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grounding touch and a managed schedule that prevents emotional overload. He endures dozens more testimonies, each a scar shared and acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe arc culminates not with another story of despair, but with one of defiant hope. The final volunteer, Michael, reframes Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacrifice as a foundational miracle\u00e2\u20ac\u201da single light that inspired an entire garden of irises to bloom. He extends his hand, vowing that the survivors will stand *beside* their Hero in the final battle, not behind him, as fellow warriors forged from shared trauma.\r\n\r\nEmotionally spent but whole, Caelus accepts this new covenant. The ordeal concludes not in the solemn temple, but in a vibrant market stall, where the family descends into a chaotic, joyful noodle war. Laughter rings out, a perfect counterpoint to the preceding grief, proving that even the most bitter seeds, when tended by love and solidarity, can yield a harvest of renewed strength and unbreakable bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Sanctuary of a Single Day (642 - 649)**\r\n\r\nExhausted by the weight of shared trauma, Caelus is spiraling into tactical planning when his family stages a quiet intervention. Led by the three women who know him best\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey orchestrate a day of stolen peace. Under the guise of necessary logistics, they arrange for him to be left alone with Celestine, the High Priestess who has carried the heaviest administrative and emotional burdens.\r\n\r\nWhat begins as a simple day of rest becomes a tender, transformative journey. From a breakfast cooked with loving precision in Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kitchen to a quiet stroll through the market where Caelus buys her a simple straw hat, their connection deepens beyond duty and trauma. Celestine leads him to a secluded sanctuary by the river, where they set up a tent with wordless harmony, creating a private world for just the two of them.\r\n\r\nWithin that sanctuary, guarded by firelight and the quiet river, their carefully maintained facades fall away. Over shared meals of freshly caught fish and under a sky of absurdly renamed constellations, they find a refuge in each other. The culmination comes not in a grand declaration, but in a whisper of sleepy honesty in the dark. Caelus, stripped of all defenses, confesses that he would be happy to be her husband\u00e2\u20ac\u201da truth he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even recall saying as he immediately falls asleep, still clutching her hand.\r\n\r\nThe morning brings them back to reality, but the sanctuary they built remains. Packing up with domestic ease and facing news of an impending war summit that will soon pull them apart, they share a final breakfast in her kitchen that tastes of hope and belonging. As Caelus returns to his family, he carries a new, quiet calm within him, though his romantic obliviousness remains endearingly intact, provoking helpless laughter from the women who love him.\r\n\r\nThe arc closes as the portal to Solphire opens, returning them all to the weight of impending war. But for one single, perfect day, two weary souls found a sanctuary in each other, building a foundation of simple, honest love that promises to weather the coming storm.\r\n\r\nit's where caelus and celestine date and where caelus got celestine home key \r\n\r\n**Chapter 650: The Weight of Divergent Duties, William's Command, and the Doctrine That Refused to Break**\r\nUpon returning to Solphire, the group immediately splits to handle their respective duties. Caelus and Lingsha observe William commanding three thousand soldiers on the training grounds. William has evolved into a brilliant teacher, instilling adaptive strategies and critical thinking in his troops rather than demanding blind obedience. Lingsha notes that they are building not just military strength, but a collective belief in survival, preparing the army to contest impossible odds.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 651: The Weight of Strategic Deception, Partner Coordination, and the Siblings Who Would Teach Through Action**\r\nSunday approaches Caelus and Liora with a strategic request to solve a training issue regarding partner coordination. He asks them to participate in the day's drills using their disguised identities, \"Kael and Kela,\" to demonstrate attainable excellence in teamwork. Caelus and Liora agree to limit their powers to a standard soldier's level and act as siblings, viewing the assignment as a chance to both teach the army and enjoy a few hours of fun and normalcy together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 652: The Weight of Ordinary Excellence, Exploited Flaws, and the Lesson That Required No Words**\r\nDisguised as Kael and Kela, Caelus and Liora enter the training grounds and engage in two-on-two combat drills. They defeat various partnerships not with overwhelming power, but with flawless synchronization and tactical awareness. Instead of dominating, they turn every match into a lesson, explaining their opponents' flaws and teaching them how to cover for one another. Their accessible excellence inspires the other soldiers to believe they can achieve similar coordination.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 653: The Weight of Rain-Soaked Joy, Commander's Assessment, and the Dance That Taught Through Laughter**\r\nHeavy rain transforms the training ground, and while others complain, Kael and Kela laugh and play, teaching the soldiers to view the weather as an asset. Commander Astraea and William challenge the siblings to a match. Through a series of intense engagements, Kael and Kela help the commanders refine their own coordination, demonstrating that perfect partnership relies on instinct and trust rather than rigid planning, all while maintaining their joyous cover.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 654: The Weight of Shared Umbrellas, Borrowed Coins, and the Drinks That Tasted Like Understanding**\r\nAfter the training concludes, Caelus and Liora revert to their true forms but maintain their sibling dynamic. Liora insists on sharing a single umbrella and treating Caelus to food and warm drinks at a local caf\u00c3\u00a9. They spend the evening writing a tactical analysis report for Sunday while sharing pastries and swapping teas. It serves as a cherished moment of peace and family connection before the return to full operational duty the next day.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 655: The Weight of Strategic Revelation, Family Foundation, and the Truth Hidden in Plain Sight**\r\nRobin and Lingsha force an exhausted Sunday to take a break for dinner, but he manages a quick debrief with Astraea first. Astraea is in awe of Kael and Kela's performance, and Sunday guides her to the realization that the secret to their perfect coordination is not technique, but the deep trust found in family. Satisfied that the lesson was learned organically, Sunday plans to restructure the army's training to foster these deep, family-like bonds among the soldiers.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 656**\r\nCelestine wakes up exhausted before the summit, confiding in her handmade doll of Caelus about his unconscious marriage proposal. Sister Mira intervenes, forcing the overworked High Priestess to delegate tasks and rest, reminding her that true strength lies in accepting help just as the Hero is learning to do. Together with the temple staff, they finalize the summit agenda, preparing to position Lumora as a neutral spiritual sanctuary to hold the fractured kingdoms together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 657**\r\nPrince Wales of Alabasta gets lost in the temple garden and falls in love at first sight with the sleeping Celestine. He bravely confesses his feelings, but Celestine gently rejects him, revealing that her heart belongs to the oblivious Hero, Caelus. They bond over the unrequited nature of her love and Caelus's traumatic history, and Wales accepts his heartbreak with scholarly grace, agreeing to remain friends.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 658**\r\nPrince Sunday and Commander Helena visit the Iris Fountain, which has become a pilgrimage site blooming with impossible flowers where Caelus was resurrected. Overwhelmed by the tangible proof of miracles and the heavy cost of Caelus's sacrifice, Sunday breaks down and apologizes to the hero's memory for his past antagonism. He resolves to protect Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctity from political corruption, recognizing it as the essential spiritual foundation for the coming war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 659**\r\nIn a private strategic meeting, Prince Sunday reveals to Celestine and Mira that the allied kingdoms are on the verge of economic collapse and that desperation is driving some humans to consider betraying the alliance to the demons. He urges Lumora to serve as an unshakeable moral anchor to prevent humanity from turning on itself. Celestine accepts this heavy burden, promising that the city will provide the spiritual conviction necessary to keep the alliance united.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 660**\r\nOn the morning of the summit, Celestine bonds with Princess Seraphine over their shared, complicated love for the oblivious Hero and the kindness he showed when rejecting Seraphine's marriage proposal. United by their personal resilience and respect for Caelus, Celestine opens the summit breakfast with a powerful call for unity. She urges the gathered delegates to stop acting like politicians and start acting like a family fighting for love.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 661**\r\nCelestine leads the formal summit session, where kingdoms report high military adoption of the anti-Valthor doctrine but reveal critical economic instability, with Sunstone admitting it faces bankruptcy in eight months. Identifying that their military progress is endangered by resource shortages, Celestine rallies the delegates to commit to a total resource-sharing network. The session concludes with a unanimous, emotional pledge of solidarity from all nations to stand with Lumora and survive together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 662: The Weight of Impossible Offers, Severed Heads, and the Vision That Shattered the Heart of the World**\r\nDuring the open session of the summit, Lord Matthias of Greymark presents a horrific proposal from demon scouts: if humanity executes Caelus and displays his severed head on the Irish Fountain, several demon lords will retreat. While Prince Sunday furiously rejects the idea as psychological warfare, Celestine is traumatized by the mental image of the desecration. The summit descends into chaos as terrified delegates begin to genuinely consider betraying their Hero for a chance at survival.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 663: The Weight of Forced Silence, Sobbing Princesses, and the Calculation That Promised Annihilation**\r\nSunday and Aldric forcibly suspend the session to stop the chaos, leaving the core allies alone in the empty hall. While Princess Seraphine breaks down over humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to betray Caelus, Sunday formulates a counter-strategy based on cold logic. He calculates that executing Caelus would turn neutral powers like Liora, Kronos, and Azrith into active enemies, guaranteeing humanity's extinction rather than saving it. They resolve to present this irrefutable calculation the next day.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 664: The Weight of Demonic Authority, Unified Threats, and the Question That Made Kingdoms Tremble**\r\nLiora interrupts the morning session, dropping her disguise to reveal herself as a Demon Lord accompanied by two succubi. She issues a terrifying ultimatum to the delegates: harming her \"little brother\" Caelus will result in immediate annihilation from her forces, along with the armies of Kronos and Azrith. Terrified by the realization that betraying the Hero would create a second demon front, the delegates are bullied into silence and forced to abandon the treasonous proposal.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 665: The Weight of Hidden Observation, Divine Conversations, and the Privilege That Made Flowers Smile**\r\nSeeking solace, Celestine finds Caelus at the Irish Fountain, happily communicating with the Goddess Solara about cooking vegetables. Liora joins her, and they watch him from the shadows, realizing he is completely oblivious to the recent plot against his life. Touched by his innocent connection to the divine, the women resolve to keep the dark truth secret to protect his peace as he cheerfully invites them to dinner.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 666: The Weight of Family Gambles, Spicy Tears, and the Flight That Left Questions Behind**\r\nCaelus cooks dinner for Celestine, Liora, and Prince Wales, introducing a chaotic \"family tradition\" involving a bowl of incredibly spicy rice. Celestine endures the spicy portion with tears in her eyes to honor his effort, deepening their bond. Afterward, Caelus reveals his divine form to fly Liora home, leaving Wales awestruck. Wales admits he cannot compete with such a being but agrees to support Caelus as a loyal friend and ally.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 667: The Weight of Morning Prayers, Sacred Ground, and the Lesson Written in Blood-Soaked Earth**\r\nOn the final morning of the summit, Celestine and Sister Mira lead the delegates in prayer at the Irish Fountain. Mira recounts the brutal reality of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacrifice and resurrection on that very spot, shaming the delegates for considering its desecration. As the flowers glow in response to their vows, the delegates are overcome with remorse and recommit themselves to protecting the Hero who died for them.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 668: The Weight of Final Calculations, Brutal Truths, and the Peace That Required Annihilation**\r\nPrince Wales presents the final war strategy, revealing a grim plan that relies on \"mutual annihilation\" to secure lasting peace. He outlines a two-pronged defense where the Hero Party engages Valthor while the main army holds off millions of demons, predicting catastrophic casualties of up to fifty percent. The delegates, sobered by the honesty and the terrifying cost of survival, applaud the strategy and steel themselves for the coming apocalypse.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 669: The Weight of Honest Farewells, Committed Hearts, and the Doll That Witnessed Everything**\r\nAs the summit concludes, Prince Wales receives closure regarding his unrequited feelings, and Celestine reaffirms that her heart belongs entirely to Caelus. Exhausted from saving the man she loves from political betrayal, Celestine retreats to her room and confides in her handmade Caelus doll. She falls asleep finding peace in the knowledge that Caelus remains safe, happy, and completely oblivious to the danger he narrowly escaped.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 670: The Weight of Fevered Rest, Unexpected Care, and the Porridge That Tasted Like Home**\r\nCelestine succumbs to severe exhaustion and fever following the intensity of the summit, unable to leave her bed. Caelus arrives unexpectedly at her high priestess private residance to invite her to a party with Robin and Lingsha but, realizing she is sick, immediately abandons the plans to take care of her. Despite her embarrassment, Caelus takes charge of her kitchen to cook a ginger-honey porridge that brings her to tears because it tastes like home. He tends to her fever with a damp cloth and gentle words, prioritizing her health over the celebration, which fills Celestine with a profound sense of peace and safety.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 671: The Weight of Borrowed Keys, Forehead Blessings, and the Access That Promised Everything**\r\nCaelus remains by Celestine's side but becomes anxious about the others waiting for him. Sensing his conflict, Celestine urges him to join his family but offers him a spare key to her residence so he can return efficiently, a gesture that symbolizes granting him permanent access to her private life. Caelus accepts the key and, before leaving, adjusts her blankets and kisses her forehead\u00e2\u20ac\u201da learned gesture of familial care that leaves Celestine overwhelmed with emotion. Alone again, she realizes he is practicing his capacity for love on her, and she vows to wait for him forever.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 672: The Weight of Borrowed Innocence, Immortalized Shame, and the Album That Promised Endless Teasing**\r\nCaelus arrives late to his surprise party, terrified of the consequences, only to find Robin, Lingsha, and Liora waiting with cake and a \"punishment\" prepared. Liora reveals an old album of drawings she made of Caelus when he was six, depicting his absurd childhood heroics like fighting rivers and trying to rescue chickens. The teasing dissolves into warmth as the women celebrate the boy who has always tried to carry the world, affirming that his protective nature is innate.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 673: The Weight of Scattered Keys, Dark Humor, and the Home That Refused Furniture**\r\nCaelus proposes a \"sky dance\" for Lingsha at sunset, poetically comparing his partners to different times of day to ensure everyone feels equally valued. He displays his collection of their house keys but sadly jokes about having no home of his own, prompting a fierce intervention from the women who insist *they* are his home. Caelus accepts this but immediately ruins the emotional moment by practically stating he prioritizes a good kitchen over emotional security.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 674: The Weight of Equal Portions, Accidental Poetry, and the Times of Day That Held No Favorites**\r\nThe group visits the sick Celestine, where Caelus force-feeds her porridge for recovery. He explains the scheduling for Lingsha's flight and inadvertently devastates the women with accidental poetry, assigning each of them a specific time of day\u00e2\u20ac\u201dDawn, Mid-morning, Evening, and Night\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat perfectly matches their personalities. They realize he manages to love them all equally and individually, finding his oblivious romance perfect.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 675: The Weight of Pillow Rights, Kitchen Priorities, and the Laughter That Held Everything**\r\nWaking up trapped by his partners, Caelus successfully negotiates \"Pillow Rights,\" arguing that he should be allowed to use them as pillows in the future. He earnestly thanks them for making him feel at home, only to immediately undercut the sentiment by reasserting his need for a kitchen over emotional safety. The women drag him to cook breakfast, celebrating their chaotic, warm, and genuine family dynamic.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 676: The Weight of Proper Requests, Confused Permissions, and the Surprise That Refused Spoiling**\r\nCaelus formally requests airspace permission from Sister Mira to prevent panic during Lingsha's flight, impressing the priestess with his unnecessary consideration. Back at Celestine's residence, he prepares food and refuses to spoil the surprise, though he admits to having multiple backup plans. The women realize he is creating a shared memory for the whole family to witness Lingsha's moment.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 677: The Weight of Borrowed Care, Delegated Joy, and the Preparation That Promised Everything**\r\nCaelus intimately cares for Celestine, establishing a pact of mutual care that leaves her overwhelmed with hope for a future where she can look after him. He instructs Robin and Liora to bring Celestine to watch the evening's event, explaining that while the moment belongs to Lingsha, he wants the whole family to witness how he sees her. Lingsha trusts him completely as they leave to prepare for the miracle.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 678: The Weight of Flower Seeds, Visible Shoulders, and the Comet That Carried Evening**\r\nLingsha wakes up and dresses in a freeing, modern outfit that leaves Caelus stunned by her beauty. After gathering hundreds of flower seeds, Caelus activates his divine form at the Irish Fountain. He lifts Lingsha and launches them into the sky like a golden comet, while his family watches from below, ready to witness the spectacle.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 679: The Weight of Bottomless Energy, Red Faces, and the Question That Promised Forever**\r\nHigh above Lumora, Caelus explains his plan to use their unified energy to make flower seeds bloom in mid-air and fall like rain. After a clumsy attempt to trigger the capability through embarrassment, Lingsha kisses him with a prayer, transferring the halo and granting her access to his infinite energy. With golden swords holding the seeds, they prepare to rain flowers upon the city.\r\n\r\nit's caelus and lingsha date \r\n\r\n**Chapter 680: The Weight of Clumsy Kisses, Overflowing Output, and the Tree That Shouldn't Exist**\r\nLingsha struggles with the energy output until Caelus initiates a \"tactical kiss\" that unleashes a torrent of power. Instead of falling flowers, the energy creates a massive, permanent tree rooted on a floating golden platform above the city. Caelus is confused by the deviation but declares it perfect, interpreting the impossible growth as a true reflection of Lingsha's nurturing spirit.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 681: The Weight of Falling Flowers, Heaven's Questions, and the Hunger That Would End Miracles**\r\nThe observers on the ground marvel at the floating tree raining warm, comforting flowers upon Lumora. Their awe turns to hysterical laughter when they realize the divine miracle's duration depends entirely on Caelus's hunger, only to remember he packed bread, ensuring the impossible structure will persist into the night.\r\n\r\nit's lingsha and caelus date\r\n\r\n**Chapter 682: The Weight of Stepped Toes, Falling Flowers, and the Dream That Tasted Like Bread**\r\nCaelus proves to be a terrible dancer on the floating island, stepping on Lingsha's feet repeatedly. However, Lingsha notices that the tree releases a flower with every mistake, interpreting it as beauty found in imperfection. After Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loud stomach interrupts the romance, they share bread, and he outlines his post-war dream: a home that is also a restaurant where the whole family works together. Lingsha is moved to tears by his oblivious but perfect proposal of a shared future.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 683: The Weight of Empty Stomachs, Eating Fabric, and the Miracle That Dissolved for Noodles**\r\nCaelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hunger becomes urgent, leading him to threaten to \"eat\" Lingsha if they don't leave, though he is completely confused by the sexual innuendo and worries about the nutritional value of her clothes. Deciding noodles are more important than architectural miracles, he dissolves the floating island. On the ground, the women watch the divine structure vanish and collapse into laughter, realizing their Hero unmade heaven simply because he wanted dinner.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 684: The Weight of Falling Together, Dark Humor, and the Noodles That Waited for Heroes**\r\nPlummeting from the sky, Caelus jokes about crashing together, while Lingsha admits that a world without him is scarier than death. He activates his wings at the last second for a safe landing, only to find that Sister Mira has brought the entire noodle feast to the fountain. The family eats together under the stars, teasing Caelus about his hunger and his accidental threats, celebrating that while miracles are temporary, their bond is forever.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 685: The Weight of Lazy Mornings, Crying Commanders, and the Flower That Healed Everything**\r\nThe group wakes up tangled together in Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed, with Caelus serving as the central pillow. Celestine discovers her fever is completely gone, healed by the residual blessing of the flowers she caught the night before. Caelus and Lingsha cook breakfast for the family, enjoying a final moment of domestic peace and laughter before they must return to Solphire and the war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 686**\r\nPrince Sunday, King Aldric, and Queen Seraphina observe the Anti-Valthor unit easily dismantle a probe of twelve thousand demons. Despite the flawless victory, Sunday reveals a grim truth: Hell is not trying to conquer them yet, but is sacrificing troops to calibrate their attacks and map humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defenses. He realizes they are trapped in a war of attrition where every victory provides Valthor with data to kill them more efficiently in the future.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 687**\r\nDemon Lord Liora visits Sunday secretly, offering him a network of succubi spies embedded in Hell to provide real-time intelligence on enemy movements. She explains that she is doing this solely to ensure Caelus survives the war. Sunday is skeptical but agrees to a test case; Liora predicts a specific attack in Valcrest in four days. Sunday prepares a list of trusted allies to receive the network's communication crystals if the intel proves true.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 688**\r\nSunday and Squad Ironshrine deploy to Valcrest in civilian disguises to verify Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intelligence. The attack occurs exactly as predicted, and the squad holds off eighteen thousand demons to protect civilians until Valcrest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main forces\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalerted by Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u201darrive to wipe out the enemy. With the intelligence verified and zero casualties sustained, Sunday and King Mordain agree to fully trust the demon network.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 689**\r\nSunday gathers trusted leaders from across the allied kingdoms and reveals the existence of the demon intelligence network. He distributes the communication crystals, explaining that their survival depends on trusting demons who are loyal to Caelus. Despite the risks and the treasonous nature of the alliance, the leaders bind the crystals with blood, accepting the network to gain a tactical advantage in the coming war of attrition.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 690**\r\nJust as the council accepts the crystals, a massive alert comes through: Valthor is constructing three fortresses simultaneously on Earth to shore up his political power, and the terrifying ancient dragon Bahamut has appeared. The Hero Party is forced to abandon the war effort to hunt the dragon, leaving humanity just eighteen hours to destroy the three fortresses on their own before they become permanent staging grounds.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 691**\r\nSunday initiates \"Operation Ant Triumph,\" ordering Commanders Astraea and Gareth to split their elite forces to attack the three fortresses. Facing odds of one hundred to one and lacking any support from the Hero Party, the commanders accept the suicide mission. They plan to use superior coordination and doctrine to swarm the massive demon garrisons across three continents simultaneously.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 692**\r\nIn Lumora, High Priestess Celestine shares a quiet farewell with her parents(at celestien parent home) before deploying for the assault. Alone in her room(at celestine private residance), she confesses her hidden love to a handmade doll of Caelus while she's naked and in the proceed of changing dress. She reveals she possesses a golden feather shed from his wings that stays warm as long as he is alive, and she packs it as her only comfort and anchor for the impossible battle ahead.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 693**\r\nPrince Sunday gathers fifteen hundred soldiers in Lumora for \"Operation Ant Triumph,\" announcing he will personally lead this front because his instinct warns of unique danger. With the Hero Party remaining in Solphire to counter the threat of the dragon Bahamut, Sunday emphasizes that this battle relies entirely on military doctrine and coordination. Despite the catastrophic odds of facing one hundred thousand demons, the army move to the battlefield with high morale, ready to prove that humans can topple giants.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 694**\r\nUpon arriving at the coordinates, the army finds only empty ground. Sunday uses the demon spy network to confirm the fortress exists but is cloaked by massive invisibility magic, validating his instinct about the danger. Elite Squad Seven uses enhanced sight to reveal the eighty-seven thousand-strong demon garrison. Sunday rallies the troops, crediting the demon spies for the intelligence, and the army prepares to assault a fortress they can now see through magical countermeasures.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 695**\r\nElite Squad Seven breaches the fortress walls, secures the gate, and kills a demon general, allowing the main force to enter. As the battle escalates, rain begins to fall, washing away the demons' invisibility advantage and revealing their positions. Utilizing past training from Caelus on fighting in adverse weather, the human forces turn the rain into a tactical asset, seizing the momentum against the disoriented demon army.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 696**\r\nThe battle intensifies as Elite Squad Seven is intercepted by twelve demon generals simultaneously. During the chaotic melee, Celestine suffers broken ribs from a sneak attack but refuses to retreat, using her healing magic to keep her squad operational. through desperate coordination and Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power, the squad systematically eliminates all twelve generals, proving their doctrine can withstand overwhelming elite power.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 697**\r\nVictory is interrupted by the arrival of a Demon Lord Candidate, a massive entity wielding a black shield and earthquake magic. The monster casts a \"black veil\" over the fortress, cutting off all external communication and trapping the human forces inside. Isolated and facing an apex predator that reshapes the terrain with every blow, the soldiers struggle to survive as the entity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domain magic turns the tide against them.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 698**\r\nAmidst the devastation, Celestine is struck by debris and brought to the brink of death. Refusing to succumb, she bites Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golden feather and writes a prayer in the air with her blood. Solara answers her devotion with a massive, temporary blessing that allows Celestine to ignore her critical injuries. She rises to heal her squad, fueled by love and divine power, keeping the army alive against the Lord Candidate's onslaught.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 699**\r\nSunday analyzes the Demon Lord Candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movements and identifies a structural weakness in its chest armor. Celestine sacrifices the last of her energy to cast a final blood-prayer, boosting Astraea to twelve blessing stacks before collapsing into unconsciousness. With this overwhelming power, Astraea leads a precise, coordinated strike that pierces the demon's heart. The entity falls, the black veil shatters, and humanity achieves a miraculous victory.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 700**\r\nAfter the Demon Lord Candidate is defeated, the ancient dragon Bahamut appears and launches a devastating laser attack to test humanity's durability. Refusing to let her soldiers die after surviving the battle, Astraea uses Caelus's golden feather and a desperate blood-prayer to activate the fallen enemy's legendary shield. The barrier successfully withstands the divine blast, satisfying Bahamut's curiosity enough for the dragon to leave, securing a miraculous survival for the exhausted human forces.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 701**\r\nSunday struggles with the heavy guilt of a twelve percent casualty rate despite achieving total victory across three fronts(12% casualty in lumora fortess, 5% at each fortress in valcrest and ashenvale ). Caelus and Robin arrive, revealing they engaged Bahamut in a sky battle to ensure the dragon left after its test. Liora comforts Sunday, reframing the survival rate as a tactical miracle rather than a failure given the overwhelming odds. With his confidence restored, Sunday joins the Hero Party and Liora in organizing the recovery efforts to bring the survivors home.\r\n\r\noperation 'ant triumph' succed. 3 Fortress breach and single demon lord candidate is eliminated, while the hero party didn't even need to intervene.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 702**\r\nCelestine wakes in excruciating pain from the backlash of her miracle, but finds Caelus holding her to help ground the agony. While he tenderly feeds her, Robin validates the mechanics of Celestine's blood-prayer and asks for the new blessing's name. Celestine names it \"Dawn Blessing\" after a story about a \"Dawnkeeper\" who refused to surrender, silently dedicating the name to Caelus and the lesson of resilience he taught her.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 703**\r\nCaelus visits the heavily bandaged Astraea, teasing her about looking like a mummy to help lift her spirits. Despite her catastrophic injuries, Astraea regains her competitive fire, promising to discipline Caelus once she heals. She reveals the legendary shield is named \"Night Watch\" and declares that it has chosen her as its new guardian, securing a powerful mobile defense asset for humanity's future battles.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 704**\r\nCelestine wakes in excruciating pain from the backlash of her miracle, clutching Caelus's feather. Caelus arrives to clean her wounds and change her bandages, performing the intimate task with absolute reverence and gentleness. Overwhelmed by his care and her own injuries, they both shed tears, but the moment solidifies Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s realization that his acts of service are his way of showing love.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 705**\r\nLiora takes Astraea to the medical tent to explain the true nature of her new shield. The artifact is a semi-sentient, prideful weapon from Hell named \"Night Watch.\" Liora reveals that the shield chose Astraea because they share the same stubborn, protective personality, and Astraea formally accepts the bond and the strict conditions required to wield it.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 706**\r\nAs the army prepares to leave, the Night Watch shield refuses to be moved by the soldiers, making itself impossibly heavy out of pride. Caelus uses his divine form to carry the \"sulking\" shield to the transport wagon, earning its respect through a display of power. He then carries Celestine to the carriage in a princess carry, and the group departs for Lumora.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 707**\r\nThe convoy is halted by the sudden appearance of Bahamut, terrifying the soldiers. However, the dragon is not attacking; it drops a massive narwhal head as a \"gift\" of gratitude for the earlier entertainment. Caelus and Robin use their unified capability to play tag with the dragon in the sky, turning a moment of terror into a joyful game before Bahamut departs.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 708**\r\nBack in Lumora, Caelus shocks the local priesthood by using his holy powers and flying swords to fillet the massive narwhal in the town square. He organizes the priestesses to cook the meat, turning the dragon's gift into a city-wide feast. The celebration helps the citizens and soldiers heal from their trauma through food and community.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 709**\r\nRobin, Lingsha, and Liora visit Celestine with a secret plan. They reveal that an upcoming political meeting involves dangerous debates regarding Caelus's safety, and they refuse to let him attend. They task Celestine with keeping Caelus occupied and oblivious at her home, vowing to handle the dark politics themselves to protect his innocence.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 710**\r\nTo ensure Caelus stays away from the temple meetings, Celestine asks him to help clean her sticky wounds personally. Caelus performs the task with deep emotion, crying over the damage to her body and blaming himself, though Celestine reassures him. He talks about future dates he wants to take her on, completely unaware that she is protecting him from the political summit.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 711**\r\nCaelus spends the day baking coffee-cocoa cookies in Celestine's kitchen. As they share the treats, he entertains her with embarrassing stories about the other party members, including Robin's sulking and a prank war between Lingsha and Liora. The domestic peace cements Celestine's feeling of truly belonging to their family while the others handle the world outside.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 712**\r\nPrince Sunday concludes a tense summit with allied delegates, securing approval for the new military doctrine and a strict non-aggression policy regarding the dragon Bahamut. Lingsha and Liora warn the assembly that the demon intelligence network must be used solely for peace, revealing that Liora is personally watching for any treachery. The delegates reaffirm their vow to protect Caelus, rejecting the dark temptation to betray him for political safety. The Hero Party returns to Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home, content to shoulder the burden of the world's darkness so Caelus can remain innocent and happy, baking cookies with his friend.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 713**\r\nCommanders William and Gareth encounter a sudden demonic rift while traveling, and their squads dismantle the threat with elite coordination. A surviving demon general offers William a deal: behead Caelus in exchange for easier war terms from Valthor. William instantly kills the demon, revealing that his motivation is not just survival, but a deep, personal vengeance against the Demon King. The commanders realize these desperate offers prove that Valthor is terrified of humanity's growing strength and unity.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 714**\r\nTen days after the operation, three thousand soldiers return safely to Solphire, having proven that human coordination can stand against demons. The commanders compare reports and find that every captured demon is offering the same deal to exchange Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head for peace. Astraea reveals she used her new shield, Night Watch, to execute a general making that same offer. The commanders agree that betraying Caelus would only prove Valthor right and destroy their alliance, resolving to maintain absolute unity.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 715**\r\nAstraea addresses the troops, announcing that Caelus will soon arrive to test them against ten percent and fifteen percent divine power\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe baseline for humanity's survival. She admits she has not mastered Night Watch and challenges the soldiers to a spar to help her find her weaknesses. Flamewing Squad is selected for the match, and they eagerly accept the chance to test their legendary commander, promising to exploit her lack of control over the semi-sentient shield.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 716**\r\nThe spar between Astraea and Flamewing Squad begins, quickly revealing Astraea's lack of synchronization with Night Watch. The shield triggers its ultimate defense accidentally, draining her energy, and fires offensive pulses wildly off-target. Flamewing Squad adapts to these flaws, outmaneuvering Astraea and forcing her to yield due to exhaustion. Astraea accepts the loss with grace, vowing to master the stubborn, prideful artifact through relentless training.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 717**\r\nAstraea struggles alone in the early morning until Caelus and Robin intervene. Caelus explains that legendary weapons require partnership and trust, not just mechanical control, demonstrating his own connection to his sword via prayer. Following his advice, Astraea offers her blood and a sincere prayer to Night Watch, asking for its help. The shield responds to her humility, establishing a deep bond that instantly improves their synchronization to eighty percent and allows her to aim its attacks.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 718**\r\nPrince Sunday watches a rematch between Astraea and Flamewing Squad to gauge her progress. This time, Astraea uses her new connection to consciously activate a controlled ultimate defense, holding a massive, impenetrable barrier for thirty minutes against constant assault. Though she eventually yields from energy depletion, she proves she can deploy a \"mobile fortress\" capable of saving armies. Sunday leaves the training ground with renewed hope, believing humanity finally has the tools to survive the coming war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 719**\r\nHigh Priestess Celestine arrives near Solphire to inspect the massive crater left by Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous power demonstration. Prince Aldric explains that the preserved destruction serves as a reminder to the soldiers of the apocalyptic power they must learn to contest. Her professional duties finished, Sister Mira releases Celestine to go find her \"family.\" Clutching Caelus's golden feather, Celestine heads for the castle, eager to reunite with the Hero who possesses the power to destroy the world but chooses to protect it instead.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 720**\r\nCaelus and Robin return to Solphire completely covered in mud after Caelus uses his divine wings to assist with a difficult pig birth at a local farm. Robin wails dramatically about the indignity, while Liora and Lingsha dissolve into laughter at the absurdity of the Hero using god-given powers for livestock midwifery. Celestine arrives and happily joins the muddy embrace, reuniting the chaotic family and diffusing Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horror with shared laughter and warmth.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 721**\r\nDuring a family dinner, the group laughs about the pig farm incident before Caelus solemnly requests permission to test his limits at twenty percent divine power in the desolate Broken Wastes. He theorizes that power beyond fifteen percent causes \"reality warping,\" similar to the environmental destruction seen in Hell. King Aldric grants permission on the condition of strict safety measures, and Robin, Lingsha, and Celestine insist on accompanying Caelus to ensure he survives the experiment.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 722**\r\nA sudden crisis erupts as the sky turns blood-red; the Demon King Valthor has deployed ten million demons to build a fortress at the Broken Wastes to save face politically. The War Council realizes that to prevent total war, Caelus must destroy this threat alone to prove humanity's dependence on him. While the leaders scramble for a strategy that balances survival and political optics, Caelus silently prepares himself to become a weapon of mass destruction once again.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 723**\r\nCaelus enters the war room drenched in sweat from preparation and agrees to the suicide mission, but asks his partners to stay behind. Robin, Lingsha, and Celestine refuse, vowing to die with him rather than let him face the apocalypse alone. United by this grim promise, the four prepare to use their \"Unified Capability\" to amplify Caelus's power, while Astraea is assigned as the fail-safe to activate the legendary shield Night Watch if they fall.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 724**\r\nAt the rally point, Astraea refuses to remain a bystander and forces her way into the mission, prompting fifty-three priestesses to buff Caelus with one hundred blessing stacks. The group marches to the fortress, where Robin kisses Caelus to activate their Unified Capability, forcing the divine halo onto her own head. Despite the agonizing time dilation and sensory overload, Robin endures the burden so they can breach the enemy stronghold together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 725**\r\nCaelus flies Robin into the fortress, where she drops a massive glacier to breach the gates before they begin slaughtering thousands of demons inside. However, a hidden Demon Lord Candidate ambushes them, shattering Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ribs and forcing him to draw the cursed sword Solareth. The curse instantly inflicts the pain of a million deaths upon Caelus, which transmits through the soul bond to Robin and Lingsha, knocking Robin unconscious and incapacitating Lingsha kilometers away.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 726**\r\nOperating in a reality-warped state of compressed time, Caelus dissects the Demon Lord Candidate and massacres the demon army while carrying the unconscious Robin. Although Robin briefly wakes to obliterate a second enemy with a pillar of lightning, the pair is eventually overwhelmed by four fresh Demon Lord Candidates. Succumbing to catastrophic wounds and exhaustion, Caelus collapses, and they are left bleeding and dying together on the fortress floor.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 727**\r\nRealizing the team is dying, Astraea and Celestine sprint into the fortress, aided by Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood-prayer that grants Astraea supernatural speed. Astraea arrives just in time to deploy Night Watch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultimate barrier, shielding the fallen couple from a killing blow. Inside the barrier, a critically injured Robin uses a desperate kiss to activate \"Temporal Reversal\" magic, destroying her own body to rewind time for Caelus and restore him to life before they both collapse.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 728**\r\nCaelus wakes up just as the ancient dragon Bahamut tears through reality, enraged that his friends were hurt. As Bahamut charges an erasure beam, Caelus grabs the women and flees, ordering Astraea to deploy a massive shield to protect Solphire from the blast. Bahamut fires, erasing the entire fortress and the ten-million-strong demon army from existence in an instant, leaving the Hero Party battered but alive in the aftermath of the dragon's vengeance.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 729**\r\nIn the quiet aftermath, Lingsha joins the pile of exhausted survivors, diagnosing Caelus with full-body muscle lock and Robin with severe neurological strain, intense headheace. Prince Sunday and the medical team arrive, overwhelmed with relief to find them alive. Refusing to be separated, the broken but victorious \"family\" piles into a single carriage to return home, leaving behind a massive crater as a testament to their survival. sunday said that liora will bring a good news tomorrow.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 730**\r\nLingsha and Celestine begin a nightly care routine for the immobilized Caelus and Robin, whose bodies are locked up from the previous battle. Despite Caelus and Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intense mortification at being washed while they are naked, treated, and dressed like children while helpless, they accept the care while refusing to let go of each other's hands. The priestesses declare they will perform this intimate service for three days until the couple recovers, framing it as a non-negotiable act of love.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 731**\r\nLiora and Queen Seraphina visit the recovering couple, bringing breakfast and maternal blessings. The group discusses the strategic aftermath of the battle, noting that the Demon King is terrified because the ancient dragon Bahamut intervened. The room dissolves into laughter when they realize the absurd truth that Caelus has accidentally befriended the world-ending dragon, and Queen Seraphina leaves with peace of mind, knowing her daughter is surrounded by people who would rewrite reality to save her.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 732**\r\nThe care routine escalates as Liora joins Lingsha and Celestine to perform deep tissue massage and trigger point therapy on the paralyzed pair. The physical release of tension forces Caelus and Robin to finally let go of their emotional stoicism, leading to shared tears of relief and trauma. After the agonizing but necessary treatment, the women watch over them as they fall into a nightmare-free sleep, safe and completely loved. but liora, lingsha, and celestine deliberetly let caelus and robin sleep in naked. while the girls sleep at diffrent chamber, wondering how the event will turn around.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 733**\r\nCaelus wakes up to find himself and Robin completely naked and entangled in bed, the others having intentionally left them that way. After a mutual panic upon realizing their predicament and the fact that their \"family\" orchestrated it as a prank, Robin decides she is too exhausted to care. Instead of retreating, she demands \"five more minutes\" of sleep and snuggles closer to him, accepting the comfort and intimacy despite the embarrassment.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 734**\r\nAt a nearby cafe, Liora, Lingsha, and Celestine laugh hysterically about the success of their plan to force Caelus and Robin into an awkward romantic situation. They later meet with Sunday and Astraea to reschedule the military assessment for three days later. They explain that this specific timeline is a strategic trick: by giving Caelus a deadline, his sense of responsibility will force him to pace his recovery properly rather than overtraining immediately.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 735**\r\nDuring lunch, the three women admit to the flushed Caelus and Robin that they deliberately left them naked to force them to relax. They inform Caelus of the rescheduled assessment, and as predicted, he accepts the delay as a necessary strategic period, unknowingly falling into their trap to ensure he rests. The meal concludes with a sense of warm, teasing familial bond, with Robin silently accepting her place beside the Hero.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 736**\r\nAstraea and Prince Sunday announce to the army that the Hero will demonstrate ten percent of his divine power in three days and that only four squads will be selected to participate in the exercise. With Elite Squad Seven already holding one spot, the remaining units compete in brutal sparring matches to earn the right to stand on the front lines. Gareth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Enhanced Squad secures the second slot, leaving the rest of the army to fight for the final two positions the following day.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 737**\r\nLiora, Lingsha, and Celestine execute a mischievous plan to force Caelus and Robin into intimacy by leaving them alone for the night to perform a \"naked care routine\" on one another. Though initially mortified, Caelus and Robin realize they genuinely need physical assistance due to their lingering injuries. Moving past the embarrassment, they wash each other with reverence and eventually share a small bathtub, finding deep peace and safety in their shared vulnerability.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 738**\r\nWhile in the bath and still naked, Robin breaks down in tears, releasing the suppressed trauma of the Solareth curse and the pain of the Temporal Reversal spell she used to save Caelus. Caelus holds her until she stabilizes, and their bond deepens as they physically support each other out of the tub when Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs fail. Later, the other women return with dinner, teasing the couple but affirming that their shared vulnerability makes them stronger, and the group settles in to sleep as a family.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 739**\r\nCaelus and Robin observe the military sparring matches to select squads for the upcoming assessment. While watching, Caelus frantically begs Robin to keep their intimate care routine a secret from Prince Sunday, terrified of his brother-in-law's reaction. Sunday and Astraea oversee the brutal elimination rounds, looking for the soldiers capable of surviving the Hero's power, while Caelus and Robin bond over their shared, embarrassing secret.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 740**\r\nLiora visits the neutral demon Lord Azrith, who invites Caelus to a tribal celebration to demonstrate to his people that the Hero is a friend, not a monster. Azrith reveals he violently rejected bribes to betray Caelus, and Liora admits she has threatened seventeen demon lords with conceptual erasure for similar assassination plots. Azrith expresses profound respect for Caelus and looks forward to the chaos the Hero will inevitably bring to his kitchens.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 741**\r\nThe ancient dragon Bahamut appears over Azrith's stronghold, playfully chasing a terrified wyvern in a game of tag. Azrith and Liora discuss how Caelus befriended the primordial entity through play rather than dominance, securing humanity a powerful ally that even the Demon King fears. Witnessing the dragon's newfound joy, Azrith finds hope that if an ancient monster can learn to play, his people can learn to live in peace.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 742**\r\nThree thousand soldiers gather to witness the assessment of the Hero Party, with Prince Sunday and Prince Aldric enforcing strict perimeter control. While the squads prepare with nervous anticipation, Caelus and Robin lie together in a field of grass far from the command tents. Caelus expresses his fear that Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lingering injuries from the Solareth curse and Temporal Reversal spell make her participation dangerous, but Robin fiercely shuts him down. She reaffirms her vow to stand beside him in both agony and ordinary life, causing Caelus to break down and finally accept her devotion with a tearful thank you.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 743**\r\nRobin helps Caelus stand, symbolizing a shift in their dynamic where she supports him. They activate their unified divine form through a prayer-kiss, merging their consciousness and sharing the burden of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power. The assessment begins with Elite Squad Seven and Enhanced Squad launching a coordinated assault, but Caelus and Robin dominate the air with perfect synchronization. To counter their aerial advantage, Commander Astraea achieves perfect synchronization with her legendary shield, Night Watch, creating a massive mobile platform that lifts the soldiers into the sky to fight on equal footing.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 744**\r\nThe battle escalates as the soldiers use a technique pioneered by Commander William to strip Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine capability with concentrated strikes. Realizing they are being boxed in, Caelus and Robin decide to overwhelm the enemy with a massive tactical escalation. They fly high above Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barrier, drop a massive sphere of ice to weaken it, and then Caelus turns himself into a living meteor using gravitational manipulation. The impact shatters the legendary barrier and devastates the battlefield, leaving the soldiers scattered but alive.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 745**\r\nImmediately following the meteor impact, Astraea orders an attack to exploit the microsecond recoil delay in Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine form. The exhausted soldiers swarm the Hero, landing strike after strike by targeting the instability in his wings. Despite Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desperate magical defense, the soldiers manage to land ten clean hits before collapsing from catastrophic exhaustion. The engagement ends with the soldiers earning a moral victory for proving humanity can contest godhood, while Caelus comforts a weeping Robin, proud that she forced him to fight seriously.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 746**\r\nLiora, Lingsha, and Celestine tend to the exhausted couple, teasing them about their intimacy while providing medical care. They move Caelus and Robin to a private carriage, where the women box Caelus in to ensure he rests. Lingsha mischievously suggests the couple might need another \"private care\" session, flustering them both. The group travels back to the castle in high spirits, prioritizing Caelus and Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emotional and physical recovery over definitions of their relationship.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 747**\r\nThe second engagement begins with Ironshrine and Flamewing squads. Commander Thorn leads Flamewing in a reckless, chaotic assault of fire and noise designed solely to overwhelm Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senses and create a smokescreen. Hidden within the environmental chaos, Commander William and Ironshrine squad move silently, using the distraction to approach Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blind spots. As Robin focuses on countering the magical barrage, William prepares to strike at the exact moment Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instincts are overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 748**\r\nIronshrine executes a perfect ambush, stripping Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine capability with coordinated strikes. William uses a dangerous technique to absorb eight stacks of blessings into his own body, shattering his sword but allowing him to deliver a devastating blow to Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structural focal point. The attack reduces Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine capability from ten percent down to three percent. The soldiers collapse in victory, having successfully brought a god to his knees through sheer tactical brilliance and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 749**\r\nInstead of ending the assessment, Caelus ascends into the sky and summons a massive storm, returning moments later at full power. He uses this terrifying display to teach the soldiers the final, grim lesson: demons do not stop when they are tired, and giving an enemy time to breathe allows them to recover. After the heavy lesson, Caelus relaxes and plays in the rain he created, tasting the water with childlike joy while his family watches affectionately.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 750**\r\nThe group retreats to a private onsen for relaxation. When Caelus enters, his towel accidentally comes undone, and in a panic, he activates a \"Divine Modesty Protocol.\" The resulting pressure wave causes everyone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s towels to fall as well, leaving the entire group naked and mortified. Liora breaks the tension with hysterical laughter about the \"fair distribution of the curse,\" and the group eventually settles into the bath, bonding over the absurdity of the moment and their shared closeness.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 751**\r\nFive friends play a game of Truth or Dare in the onsen that quickly shifts from playful to deeply emotional. Liora reveals Caelus once tried to arrest a chicken as a child, while Robin and Celestine confess their profound fear of losing him and their desire for closeness. Despite the intense mortification of their shared secrets, the group bonds over their vulnerability, affirming their love for one another as a chosen family.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 752**\r\nFollowing the bath, the women enforce strict ryokan etiquette, insisting Caelus wear a yukata with nothing underneath. After he reluctantly complies, the group retires to their suite where the sleeping arrangements are predetermined: Caelus is positioned in the center of the futons to serve as a pillow for the women. They fall asleep in a \"cuddle pile,\" reinforcing their comfort and intimacy.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 753**\r\nDuring a dawn soak, Caelus suffers a towel malfunction and claims to have adopted a \"Stoic\" philosophy of acceptance to salvage his dignity. The women playfully weaponize his logic by discarding their own towels, forcing a shared and hilarious vulnerability. Caelus eventually laughs at the absurdity, and the group finds freedom in being completely unmasked together.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 754**\r\nAt breakfast, Caelus becomes manically enthusiastic about the buffet, prompting Liora to sit on his lap to physically slow down his eating. The group discusses Caelus and Liora's upcoming diplomatic trip to a demon tribal celebration. After exchanging affectionate farewells and promises to make family memories upon their return, Caelus and Liora depart through a portal to Hell.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 755**\r\nArriving at Liora's castle, Caelus faces teasing from the succubi who view his trip as a romantic excursion. Sylvia explicitly points out that attending a festival together for days resembles a date. Caelus discovers that Liora keeps his formal wear stored next to hers, realizing that to the outside world, they present as a coordinated, paired unit.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 756**\r\nCaelus and Liora arrive at the Shattered Peaks, the massive territory of the ancient demon lord Azrith. They witness a warrior demonstration where Dullahan soldiers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dformer subordinates of a lord Caelus killed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhonor him for granting their master a warrior's death. Caelus is introduced to Azrith's three wives and the demon lord himself, who welcomes them with genuine warmth and trust.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 757**\r\nAzrith's wives show the guests to their quarters, teasingly providing a single room with one large bed based on the assumption that Caelus and Liora are a couple. Liora explains that this is how the world perceives their bond. They settle into the bed together, discussing the stability of Azrith's rule and the nature of their own relationship before falling asleep hand-in-hand.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 758**\r\nThe ancient dragon Bahamut arrives to play tag with a wyvern, delighting the demon populace who view it as a sign of good fortune thanks to Caelus's influence. During the opening feast, Caelus is baffled by headless Dullahan drinking wine but accidentally charms everyone with his innocent confusion. Lord Azrith gives a speech honoring Caelus not just for his strength, but for the respect he showed to the fallen demon lord Dreadnox, cementing Caelus's status as an honored guest.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 759**\r\nAs the feast turns into a banquet, Caelus treats the food selection like a tactical operation, meticulously curating a plate for Liora based on her specific taste preferences. They feed each other in a display of profound, natural intimacy that the watching demons recognize as deep trust. Liora is moved by Caelus's devotion to her happiness, telling him that his care is a form of love even if he doesn't have the vocabulary for it yet.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 760**\r\nAzrith publicly thanks Caelus for transforming the dragon from a lonely god into a playful friend, but Caelus humbly worries about paying for the vegetables he used to feed it. Later, Caelus asks the Dullahan for help preparing food for the dragon's next visit; they scold him for asking politely instead of commanding them as a respected warrior. Back in their room, an exhausted Caelus drifts off to sleep and finally tells Liora he loves her, leaving her weeping with joy at the long-awaited admission.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 761**\r\nCaelus and Liora attend the warrior demonstrations in the colosseum, where Caelus struggles to suppress his tactical analysis while watching the Dullahan's perfect coordination. Inspired by the mutual respect among the fighters, Caelus proposes a future where human and demon warriors guard borders together for defense rather than conquest. Azrith and his wives agree that the idea is naive and impossible, which is exactly why they agree to try it after the war.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 762**\r\nThe celebration shifts to a chaotic territorial race involving monstrous mounts and magic. Caelus borrows a brave headless horse named Night-stride and invites Liora to ride with him, prioritizing a shared experience over winning. While other racers launch with explosive speed and flight magic, Caelus and Liora trot along leisurely, laughing at the absurdity of a race where physics is optional and enjoyment is the only goal.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 763**\r\nThe race reaches the deadly Razor's Edge cliff just as Bahamut flies overhead playing tag. Caelus seizes the opportunity and rides Night-stride off the eight-thousand-meter cliff, using his divine wings to control their fall. They land successfully on the oblivious dragon's back, turning the race into an impossible adventure where a human, a demon lord, and a headless horse hitch a ride on a god.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 764**\r\nTo steer the dragon toward the finish line, Caelus and Night-stride recklessly climb up Bahamut's neck to its head. Caelus uses energy swords to gently guide the fleeing wyvern, causing Bahamut to unwittingly follow the race route. They cross the finish line just ahead of Azrith, winning the competition by hijacking a dragon, cementing Caelus's legend as the most creatively insane hero in Hell's history.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 765**\r\nCaelus and Liora share an intimate moment feeding each other at the feast while joking about Robin's potential reaction to the race. Bahamut contributes two massive fish heads, which Caelus and the Dullahan expertly butcher and cook. Caelus establishes a ritual of trust by flying the prepared dishes directly into the dragon's mouth. The dragon reciprocates with an affectionate nudge, cementing their friendship before Liora drags Caelus back to eat.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 766**\r\nCaelus and the Dullahan deliver the final massive fish dish into Bahamut's mouth using a strict safety protocol, earning the crowd's applause. Bahamut then clumsily mimics an invitation gesture, offering rides to the attendees. A diverse group, including Caelus, Liora, and Azrith's wives, climb aboard. The dragon launches into a powerful flight, sharing the joy of movement and companionship with its passengers high above the Shattered Peaks.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 767**\r\nBahamut transports the group to Layer Three, revealing a stunning endless ocean under twin moons, before moving to Layer Four, a time-warped desert filled with mirrors. The mirrors reveal a heartbreaking truth: Bahamut has always been and is predicted to always be eternally alone. Devastated, Caelus rallies the group, declaring that they can rewrite this fate by choosing to be present now, and the passengers vow to ensure the dragon never faces that loneliness again.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 768**\r\nUpon returning to the Shattered Peaks, Caelus initiates a group embrace of the dragon's snout, joined by the passengers and eventually the entire crowd. Azrith and the demons offer their warmth after learning of the dragon's cursed solitude. Caelus tells Bahamut directly that it is loved and no longer alone, causing the primordial entity to shed a tear as it finally understands the reality of friendship and acceptance.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 769**\r\nRobin, Celestine, and Lingsha wake up missing Caelus after seventeen days of separation. They receive word that he is returning from Hell that evening after winning a race, and they spend the day preparing a welcome feast and tending to their military and healing duties. Determined to show they have remained strong in his absence, they coordinate their schedules to ensure a perfect reunion.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 770**\r\nCommander Astraea raises concerns to Prince Sunday about the lack of dangerous missions and her instinct\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvalidated by the Night Watch shield\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat demon spies are watching Solphire. Sunday authorizes a covert investigation outside compromised military channels. Astraea recruits Celestine for her sharp instincts, and they plan to begin their undercover surveillance of the city the following day.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 771**\r\nDisguised as civilians, Celestine and Astraea investigate the market district while shopping for Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome dinner. Through casual conversations with vendors, they uncover disturbing patterns of espionage, including mysterious travelers asking military questions and suspicious night operations. Confirmed in their suspicions of organized surveillance, they decide to prioritize Caelus's homecoming tonight and begin the real hunt the next morning.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 772**\r\nCaelus returns from Hell with an exhausted Liora, immediately launching into enthusiastic lectures about cooking ingredients. Liora reveals she had to kiss him forty-seven times to stop his rambling during the trip and passes this \"Tactical Kiss Protocol\" duty to his partners. The group shares a joyful reunion dinner, delighted by his safe return and the restoration of their family unit.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 773**\r\nCaelus wakes up surrounded by Robin, Celestine, and Lingsha, who refuse to let him leave the bed despite his complaints about the heat. When he attempts to resume work, the women utilize the \"Tactical Kiss Protocol\" to force him to rest. They silently agree to keep him in the dark about the ongoing espionage investigation to protect him from worry.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 774**\r\nLeaving Caelus distracted, Celestine joins Astraea for their covert mission. Astraea reveals that Sunday suspects the military communication network is compromised, necessitating total secrecy. They establish their roles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCelestine as the detective and Astraea as the enforcer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand decide to investigate the merchant networks first to identify the infiltrators.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 775**\r\nCelestine gathers intelligence on suspicious nighttime trade consortiums, while Astraea is enraged by a merchant attempting to bribe her for access to Caelus's blessings. They realize that human greed and the commodification of the Hero are being used as cover for the espionage operations. The pair regroups to connect the suspicious merchant activity with the intelligence leaks.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 776**\r\nDuring a storm stakeout, Astraea and Celestine intervene to save a fleeing merchant from an enraged wyvern using non-lethal force. Upon inspecting the merchant's cargo, they discover unregistered crates and coded documents. They arrest the man, confirming they have caught one of the operatives involved in the surveillance network.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 777**\r\nUnder interrogation, the captured merchant reveals he works for foreign operatives from allied kingdoms who are creating corruption and distrust to fracture the human alliance. Sunday and Astraea realize this strategy serves the Demon King perfectly, even without direct demon involvement. They decide to handle the betrayal quietly to prevent the alliance from collapsing, keeping the truth from Caelus.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 778**\r\nSunday contacts the succubus intelligence network, learning that Liora is aware of the corruption but feigning ignorance to spare humanity from her wrath. The succubus agent reveals that while standard demon intelligence is unlikely to be involved, a legendary elite unit called \"Damazti\" fits the profile of this sophisticated operation. The group agrees to investigate this potential demon threat while maintaining secrecy.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 779**\r\nRobin and Celestine travel to Ashenvale, where they coordinate with Princess Seraphine and King Aldric, discovering that the kingdom faces similar infiltration by agents claiming false diplomatic immunity. Realizing a third party is manipulating all three kingdoms to incite distrust, they establish a secure communication channel. They depart for Valcrest to continue the investigation, determined to cut the puppet strings before the alliance falls apart.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 780**\r\nRobin and Celestine arrive at Thornhaven exhausted, with Celestine seeking comfort in a Caelus doll. They encounter a hostile reception at the city gates from suspicious guards but are rescued by Princess Elara, who appears haggard and stressed. Elara warns them that Valcrest is deeply compromised by infiltration and advises them to stay within the guest residence for their safety, hinting that the situation is far worse than they anticipate.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 781**\r\nSylvia contacts Robin with urgent intelligence that a Damazti operative is in Valcrest, possessing the abilities of perfect mimicry and parasitic control. Realizing that anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding Princess Elara\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcould be the enemy, Robin and Celestine establish strict identity verification protocols based on private memories. They agree to remain inseparable to prevent being replaced by the shapeshifter while they navigate the diplomatic meetings.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 782**\r\nRobin and Celestine meet Elara for breakfast, where the princess explains that Valcrest is facing coordinated political instability and economic desperation weaponized to recruit spies. While the meeting proceeds with diplomatic normalcy, Robin and Celestine remain on high alert, analyzing Elara for any inconsistencies. They agree to share intelligence, though the protagonists remain unsure if they are speaking to an ally or the demon operative.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 783**\r\nPrince Aldric interrupts the meeting, presenting documents that seemingly prove Sunstone and Ashenvale are betraying Valcrest. He reveals that he initiated counter-espionage operations based on Elara's suggestion, which resulted in these misleading but factually accurate reports. refusing to trust the alliance due to Sunday's past manipulations, Aldric places Robin and Celestine under house arrest until Sunday arrives to answer for the accusations.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 784**\r\nConfined to their quarters, Celestine realizes a critical inconsistency: the real Elara, who possesses a naturally trusting nature, would never have suggested espionage as a first response. They deduce that Elara is the host of the Damazti parasite and that the demon has been orchestrating the conspiracy from within. They plan to wait for Astraea to arrive and use her Night Watch shield to prove the princess is possessed.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 785**\r\nTwo days later, Sunday and Astraea burst into the war room just as Aldric prepares to declare hostilities. Astraea touches Elara, triggering her shield and confirming the demonic presence. The group magically restrains Elara to prevent the parasite from killing her, and during a tense interrogation via crystal, the Damazti admits to controlling the princess for months, noting that Elara has been fighting back mentally the entire time.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 786**\r\nSylvia arrives via a portal to perform emergency surgery before the parasite's deadman protocol destroys Elara's brain. In a high-stakes procedure, Sylvia extracts the parasite while Celestine uses massive amounts of divine magic to keep the princess alive and Astraea contains the entity. The operation is successful; the parasite is destroyed, and Elara is saved, though the team(Celestine and slyvia) is left exhausted and aware that more operatives exist.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 780**\r\nRobin and Celestine arrive in Valcrest after an exhausting journey, only to be met with hostility at the gates due to missing diplomatic records. Princess Elara intervenes to rescue them, though she appears haggard and stressed. She reveals that the kingdom is facing severe internal political instability before arranging a formal meeting for the next morning.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 781**\r\nSylvia contacts Robin via crystal to warn that a Damazti operative\u00e2\u20ac\u201da demon capable of perfect mimicry and parasitic possession\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhas infiltrated Valcrest. Realizing they cannot trust anyone, Robin and Celestine establish secret verification questions to ensure they aren't replaced. They resolve to attend the meeting with Elara while maintaining extreme vigilance against the shapeshifter.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 782**\r\nRobin and Celestine meet Elara for breakfast, where she outlines three major crises: political attacks on the royal family, economic strain from war preparations, and foreign espionage. While the meeting seems diplomatically normal, Robin remains paranoid that Elara might be the Damazti operative. They agree to share intelligence, though Robin privately fears walking into a trap.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 783**\r\nPrince Aldric interrupts the meeting with guards, presenting documents that accuse Sunstone and Ashenvale of betrayal and exploitation. He reveals that Elara was the one who suggested the counter-espionage operation that produced these misleading reports. Despite Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protests that the data is manipulated, Aldric places both women under house arrest until Prince Sunday arrives.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 784**\r\nConfined to the diplomatic residence, Celestine realizes a critical inconsistency: the kind-hearted real Elara would never have suggested espionage as a first response to a crisis. This contradiction confirms that Elara is being controlled by the Damazti parasite. They decide to wait for Sunday and Astraea to arrive so they can use Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shield to prove the possession.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 785**\r\nTwo days later, Sunday and Astraea arrive and break Robin and Celestine out to interrupt Aldric before he declares hostilities. They force a physical test using Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shield, which confirms the demonic presence within Elara. Damazti confesses to the possession but reveals that Elara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong will caused the operational imperfections that allowed them to be caught.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 786**\r\nSylvia arrives via portal to perform emergency cranial surgery before a kill-switch destroys Elara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain. In a high-stakes procedure, Sylvia extracts the parasite while Celestine uses a divine blessing to keep the princess alive and repairing. The operation is successful, the demon is destroyed, and Elara is saved, securing a vital victory for the alliance.\r\nThe parasite surgery was succedd with elara still unconscious and pale face because of Nightmare.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 795**\r\nCaelus struggles to finish an immense breakfast prepared by Mother Serra as a gesture of gratitude, eventually receiving help from Robin and Celestine. During their farewells, Princess Elara reveals that the memory of Caelus catching a salmon with liora making the demon lord reck of fish smell(Because while elera still unconscious, caelus give her golden feathers ) helps anchor her against the pain of her recovery. To protect Caelus from the weight of his own heroism and guilt, his companions mercilessly tease him about \"marrying a salmon,\" turning his compassion into a running joke. The group departs, with Robin and Celestine secretly maintaining strict security protocols around the oblivious Caelus.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 796**\r\nOn the road back to Solphire, a rift opens and releases two hundred demons near a village. Elite Squad Seven requests to handle the threat alone and slaughters the demons with perfect efficiency, proving the success of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doctrine. The group stays in the saved village for the night. Robin and Celestine refuse to leave Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side, disguising their extreme paranoia and protective measures as affection so Caelus remains unaware of the potential for human betrayal.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 797**\r\nIn Thornhaven, Sunday and Astraea present evidence that humans are voluntarily worshipping the Demon King Valthor, believing he brings necessary order. Elara confirms the accuracy of the intelligence based on her recovered memories. Realizing the cult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency plan is to target the trusting Hero, Elara insists on an immediate raid. Prince Aldric agrees to mobilize forces to dismantle the network and capture the cultists before they can move against Caelus.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 798**\r\nThe leadership team deepens their analysis, realizing the cult uses Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past sins as propaganda to recruit members. They identify a specific underground location where the cult meets. Faced with the choice of surveillance or action, Elara argues that Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to see humans as enemies makes him too vulnerable to wait. Aldric orders a raid for the following night to crush the organization and protect the Hero from the human monsters he would never suspect.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 799**\r\nThe village of Millbrook throws a celebratory feast for their saviors. Caelus happily entertains the local children, completely relaxed. However, Robin and Celestine remain hyper-vigilant, noting that Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demon-sensing sword is silent because the potential threats are human. Robin steps away to receive an urgent communication from Sunday, while Celestine stays close to Caelus, maintaining a facade of normalcy to protect his innocence while preparing for violence.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 800**\r\nThe village celebration turns into a nightmare when the grateful villagers, including the children, reveal themselves to be Valthor cultists and attempt a coordinated assassination. Celestine uses explosive magic to blast the crowd back and brutally kills an attacker head inches from Caelus, while Robin freezes the square and Elite Squad Seven neutralizes the mob. Though physically unharmed, Caelus is psychologically shattered by the realization that the people he saved tried to kill him.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 801**\r\nCaelus suffers a complete psychological breakdown in the village square, physically retching and trembling as his spirit wings manifest defensively to cocoon him and his companions. While Elite Squad Seven secures the area and catalogs the dead\u00e2\u20ac\u201drevealing that the entire village, including children, participated in the assassination attempt\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin and Celestine move Caelus to an empty inn to clean the blood from his body. As they wait for emergency reinforcements, Celestine confesses the trauma of her first human kill, and the three huddle together in a shared vigil of grief and shock.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 802**\r\nDemon Lord Liora and High Priestess Lingsha arrive via emergency portal; Lingsha immediately tends to Caelus while Liora suppresses her apocalyptic rage to manage the investigation. Liora summons Prince Sunday, Prince Aldric, and Commander Astraea to the scene, revealing that their earlier \"reckless\" raid on the cult actually saved Caelus by forcing the assassins to strike prematurely. Faced with the horror of the coordinated betrayal, Liora issues a chilling ultimatum: the human kingdoms must execute every single conspirator, or she will implement her own terrifying version of justice.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 803**\r\nIn the Thornhaven war room, Liora and her succubus advisor Selene dump a massive collection of intelligence documents that identify exactly 2,735 conspirators across multiple kingdoms. The spies reveal a vast network of nobles, merchants, and officials who funded and planned the assassination, proving the betrayal runs deep within human society. Realizing that the alliance hangs by a thread, the exhausted human leaders agree to Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for a systematic purge, committing to execute every individual on the list to prove they value the Hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life over political stability.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 804**\r\nThe sky above Thornhaven tears open as the ancient dragon Bahamut arrives, having sensed Caelus's distress across dimensional barriers. While the war room leaders watch in terror, fearing the dragon might destroy humanity for betraying his friend, a physically and emotionally exhausted Caelus walks out to the gates to greet the beast. The terrifying standoff resolves into a moment of profound gentleness as Caelus hugs the dragon's snout, proving that even after devastating betrayal, he refuses to weaponize his power against the people he protects.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 805\r\nThe open ground outside Thornhaven becomes a gathering place where soldiers, civilians, and nobility witness Caelus comforting Bahamut. The crowd weeps openly as they watch the exhausted Hero choose kindness and gentleness despite the devastating revelation that thousands of humans conspired to kill him. Lingsha identifies this refusal to let cruelty change him as true divinity, while military veterans break down realizing Caelus is using his friendship with an apocalyptic dragon for play rather than vengeance. Princess Elara and Mother Serra mourn the near-loss of Caelus's innocence, acknowledging that his trusting nature is what the world needs most. Caelus gently talks to the lonely dragon, offering companionship and a fishing trip, before flying off with a promise to return by sunset. Following his departure, Prince Sunday announces that the 2,735 confirmed conspirators will face execution for treason. Prince Aldric and Commander Astraea vow merciless justice, with Astraea promising to personally oversee interrogations to prove the world values Caelus's life. The leadership remains in vigil for Caelus's return, committed to a systematic purge of the traitors while the Hero plays with his friend.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 806 \r\nActive character:(Sunday of sunstone, astraea, prince aldric of valcrest, and princess seraphine, while liora was temporary)\r\nThe Valcrest interrogation facility is prepared with magical restraints to hold the twenty primary conspiracy leaders, including ten Damazti hosts. Demon Lord Liora uses her power to open twenty simultaneous portals(exclusive demon lord magic) to transport the prisoners but leaves the chamber to avoid killing them in a rage. Commander Astraea leads the brutal interrogation, where prisoners confirm a vast network of safe houses and reveal their ideology that Valthor represents necessary order. When a corrupted priest invites the tribunal to join the cult and frames Caelus's murder as a theological necessity, Prince Sunday brutally beats him into near-unconsciousness. The conspirators admit their sole objective was killing the Hero to enable Valthor's reign. Astraea sentences all twenty prisoners to public execution by burning and orders the extraction of parasites from the infected hosts. The chapter concludes with the commencement of a systematic purge of all 2,735 conspirators across the allied kingdoms.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 807 \r\nThe medical facility is transformed into a surgical theater where succubus teams led by Sylvia attempt to extract parasites from the ten infected leaders. Sylvia discovers that the Damazti parasites are forty centimeters long and have integrated so deeply into the brainstems that the hosts are effectively dead and unrecoverable. Realizing that infection over a year erases the host's consciousness, Prince Aldric orders the termination of all hosts and the destruction of the parasites. Sylvia systematically crushes the extracted parasites, destroying the massive, armored creatures that had consumed the humans from the inside. High Priestess Celestine and Aldric document the horror to establish a timeline for future detection, acknowledging that mercy in this case means final destruction. The procedure ends with the total elimination of the parasites and the grim understanding of the enemy's true, nightmarish scale.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 808**\r\nCaelus returns from his journey with Bahamut, exhausted but spirited, and his family tends to him with food and fresh clothes. He recounts his adventures in Antarctica, including playing with the dragon in the deep ocean and being bitten by a protective penguin mother. The women listen affectionately, shielding him from the day's dark events to preserve his innocent joy.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 809**\r\nThe leadership team gathers for dinner, traumatized and unable to eat after the day's horrors until Sylvia forces them to fuel their bodies. The mood shifts when they share the story of Caelus catching salmon mid-flight during a rescue, realizing his absurd kindness is what anchors them. Sylvia orders everyone to sleep, taking over the coordination duties herself to ensure they are rested for the executions.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 810**\r\nIn the town square, the ten conspirators are publicly executed by burning while Caelus is kept away to protect his innocence. King Mordain addresses the solemn crowd, and Princess Elara stands from her wheelchair to confront the condemned, declaring their failure to destroy the Hero. The leaders bear witness to the brutal justice so Caelus never has to, vowing to keep the reality of their actions hidden from him.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 811**\r\nRobin and Celestine visit Aldric and Elara to confirm the princess is healing well and to discuss logistics(Hero party will return to solphire). They reveal that Caelus is baking an elaborate penguin cake to honor the bird that bit him and plans to fly the family home on Bahamut. The group agrees to enthusiastically partake in the cake and the dragon ride, committing to their conspiracy of love to maintain Caelus's view of a good world.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 812**\r\nAt a garden gathering, Caelus presents his engineered penguin cake, which Lingsha warns will transmit his unfiltered emotions to those who eat it. The group tastes his joy and peace, followed by a devastating wave of self-blame and the belief that he deserves his suffering. Overcome with emotion, the leaders surround Caelus with fierce affirmations and apologies, vowing to protect him and proving he is worthy of love before they depart on the dragon.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 813**\r\nElite Squad Seven discovers a hidden laboratory beneath the cult's headquarters, and Astraea ensures the soldiers understand the stakes by sharing the emotional cake with them. The leadership investigates the lab, finding a living parasite and proof that the cult was weeks away from successfully cloning them for mass infection. Horrified, Aldric orders the immediate destruction of the research and accelerates the execution of all remaining conspirators, vowing to hide this betrayal from Caelus forever.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 814: The Weight of Red Ground, Scubi Intelligence, and the Exception That Stood Alone**  \r\nSunday and Aldric oversee executions in Thornhaven. Over 100 conspirators are killed, but none break or give intelligence. Sylvia reports that only two Damazti labs existed\u00e2\u20ac\u201done already destroyed by Liora, the other in Alabasta. She warns that only Caelus is physically strong enough to resist the parasites and instructs them to use Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shield for weekly infection checks. They contact Wales to destroy the Alabasta lab immediately.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 815: The Weight of Red Justice, Fish-Stained Priestesses, and the Laughter That Followed Horror**  \r\nRobin oversees executions in Sunstone, carrying the emotional burden. Selene supports her. Afterward, they meet Celestine, who is covered in fish after being recruited by Caelus for a cooking lesson. The absurd moment lightens the mood. Robin cleans up and joins Caelus at the training ground, where he earnestly teaches soldiers fish preparation as survival skills.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 816: The Weight of Four Days' Blood, Fish-Based Doctrine, and the Cooking Class That Conquered Strategy**  \r\nRobin completes four days of executions. Sunday returns from Valcrest and is astonished to find Caelus has turned the training ground into a cooking class, teaching \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Divine Technique of Fish Fillet Doctrine.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The group attends his demonstration, finding relief and joy in his absurd sincerity, which reinforces why they carry the burden of the executions.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 817: The Weight of Nightmares, Fish-Scented Salvation, and the Embrace That Rewrote Dreams**  \r\nRobin has a nightmare about the executions, but it transforms when Caelus appears and turns it into a comforting dream about cooking fish. She wakes to find herself comforted by his fish scent. Caelus and Celestine share a quiet morning, acknowledging how his absurdity provides emotional safety for everyone.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 818: The Weight of Borrowed Freedom, Fish-Based Combat Theory, and the Dance That Turned Doctrine into Joy**  \r\nSunday intervenes and takes over Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final day of executions, giving her a break. Robin and selene goes to the training ground, where Caelus is teaching partnered combat using fish-filleting analogies. She joins a demonstration, and they fight in perfect sync while using ridiculous fish-based technique names. The experience brings her joy and reminds her why they protect Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innocence.\r\nthe girls was won by protecting caelus Innocence from world darkness.\r\n\r\n# Chapter Summaries\r\n\r\n## Chapter 819: Morning Routines and Stoic Betrayals\r\nCaelus loses rock-paper-scissors and gets last bath. The women emerge from bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCelestine and Lingsha in towels, but Liora completely naked, citing Caelus's own \"stoic philosophy\" teaching. They tease him about the naked bath incident with Robin and the therapeutic massages. The women explain their morning routine teaches him to accept vulnerability and being human with family. They're teaching him he's allowed to be seen and loved as he is.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 820: Stolen Priestesses and Remote Duties\r\nCaelus picks up Celestine and Lingsha from temple. Sister Mira teases him about \"stealing\" Lumora's High Priestesses\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth Lingsha and Celestine joined his quest. She explains Lumora is stable now: Elder Matthias leads well, Valorin's corruption is gone, and the Iris Fountain miracle reminds people of divine presence. Celestine works remotely on administrative duties with Lingsha's help, reducing her burden significantly.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 821: Kitchen Lessons and Peaceful Moments\r\nCaelus teaches Celestine cooking while Robin and Lingsha work on documents (and steal food samples). Prince Sunday and Commander Helena arrive exhausted from grain protocol negotiations. The group shares dinner and plays cards\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSunday can't bluff, Caelus accidentally reveals his strategy, Robin wins through tactical brilliance. Liora watches her family with contentment, reflecting this peaceful warmth is what she fought for\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe same warmth she felt 17 years ago in Clearwater Village.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 822: Encrypted Debts and Hidden Messages\r\nLiora receives intelligence: an encrypted message from an unknown source in Hell's Layer Seven dungeon. She recognizes the encryption pattern\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe same one used 17 years ago when someone eliminated all assassination threats against her in one night. The decoded message: \"Little Liora. If you trust me, could you help and pick me up in the Great Dungeon at Hell Layer Seven.\" Signed \"A.M.\" Liora realizes this person saved her life and is now calling in the debt.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 823: Second Messages and Divine Plans\r\nSylvia reports a second encrypted transmission with more details. A.M. mentions the \"village by the river,\" the \"boy with gray hair,\" and mercy shown. They've been imprisoned for 17 years\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe exact duration since helping Liora. Liora suspects A.M. was erased from history by Valthor. Her operatives coordinate with Time Lord Kronos: he can create a temporal bridge bypassing Layers 5-6, depositing them directly at the dungeon. Extraction protocols arranged. Liora decides to keep this secret from Caelus temporarily.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 824: Shared Water and Longevity Promises\r\nIn the onsen, Caelus notices Liora carrying emotional weight and asks what's wrong, referencing her promise not to hide things. Unable to lie to his earnest concern, Liora tells him everything about the messages and infiltration plan. Caelus immediately insists on coming with her, citing their longevity noodle promise and his experience rescuing her from Valthor before. They embrace in the water, vowing: \"Wherever I go, you're with me. Including death. Nothing will ever separate us.\"\r\n\r\n## Chapter 825: Soul Bonds and Family Intervention\r\nThe party returns to find Robin, Lingsha, and Celestine waiting\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey sensed through the soul bond that something significant was being planned without them. Robin threatens to \"bite his head\" per her previous promise. Under countdown pressure, Caelus explains everything. The women declare they're coming too\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe soul bond means they'll feel his pain anyway, better to be there to help. Robin's tactical analysis confirms Kronos's infrastructure supports five people. They refuse to be protected by being left behind. King Aldric and Queen Seraphina reluctantly grant permission after witnessing Kronos's power.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 826: Parental Permission and Temporal Bridges\r\nCaelus and Robin formally request permission from King Aldric, Queen Seraphina, and Prince Sunday. The royals are terrified but recognize they can't stop them. Robin demonstrates their thorough contingency planning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dKronos's temporal bridge, scubi operatives, Lord Azrith's sanctuary offer. The family grants reluctant permission with strict conditions: use extraction protocols if needed, no heroic sacrifices, mandatory month of rest after return. Robin summons Kronos to prove their contingencies are real\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Time Lord appears in his dissolved land tomb, confirms he'll extract them if necessary, and cryptically states this mission will reveal consequences of kindness planted 17 years ago.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 827: Final Farewells and Departure\r\nThe Hero Party prepares to depart. Caelus worries about Celestine's capability in Hell's environment, but she and Lingsha assure him she's strong\u00e2\u20ac\u201dblessed by Solara directly, experienced in dungeon investigation, nearly equal to Lingsha in durability. Sister Mira, Commanders William, Gareth, and Astraea offer farewells and backup extraction promises. Sunday and the King/Queen give final blessings. Commander Astraea confidently states they'll return and they should prepare a feast. Liora opens the portal and they step through together to Kronos's domain, then onward to Layer Seven.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 828: Dungeon Laws and Ancient Intelligence\r\nIn Kronos's tomb, he confirms their readiness by testing their dungeon knowledge. Celestine explains environmental assessment, spatial awareness, resource management, and extraction planning from her 17 dungeon investigations. Robin details how each dungeon creates its own localized reality with unique laws. Kronos approves\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey understand the fundamental challenge. He reveals the Great Dungeon analyzes who enters and crafts customized challenges. Liora deduces A.M. is someone erased from history who saved her 17 years ago. Kronos confirms he thought they were dead but they'd been hiding skillfully. He opens the temporal bridge to Layer Seven.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 829: Keychain Transformation and Separation\r\nThey enter the dungeon and its law activates instantly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtransforming Robin, Lingsha, Celestine, and Liora into keychains, scattering them on the floor. Only Caelus remains human and active. Panic rising, he finds four keychains with distinct designs representing each woman. The soul bond confirms Robin and Lingsha are alive but muted. He discovers Solareth's hilt has a small circle\u00e2\u20ac\u201done keychain can be attached to restore that person temporarily. He summons Celestine first. The dungeon forces them to watch a reconstruction of Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus's death, Valthor's hand through his chest, Lingsha and Celestine desperately trying to heal his corpse. The challenge begins.\r\n\r\nDungeon law: each person got diffrent challange, in which everyone in hero party turn into keychain and caelus need to use a tip from his solareth to hook the keychain to summon the girl. only one at time. \r\n\r\n## Chapter 830: Replayed Nightmares and Fishing Challenges\r\nCaelus fights wolf-swarms on the first floor, then the dungeon reconstructs Lumora plaza\u00e2\u20ac\u201dforcing him to watch his own death from outside perspective. He sees Lingsha and Celestine's desperate attempts to heal his corpse, their refusal to stop even when it was hopeless. Overwhelmed by witnessing their trauma, he summons Celestine using the keychain mechanism. She materializes and they both watch the nightmare reconstruction together. They comfort each other\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\"I'm here, I'm alive, I came back.\" The scene finally fades. The second floor presents a bizarre challenge: a ghost and aquatic monster challenge them to a fishing competition with hostile, murderous fish. Caelus and Celestine coordinate perfectly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe uses Dawn Blessing flashes tactically while he handles physical catching. Their partnership defeats both competitors through coordination rather than individual skill.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 831: Hell's Fury and Instant Swap\r\nThe second floor erupts with massive earthquake and blood tsunami carrying nightmare fish that kill the ghost and monster from the first floor. Caelus realizes he needs Robin's ice magic specifically for this threat. He swaps keychains mid-crisis\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCelestine transforms back, Robin materializes disoriented. Caelus kisses her immediately to activate Unified Capability without explanation. Robin responds on pure instinct, praying to Solara. The halo descends to her, merging their consciousness. She unleashes ice magic amplified to impossible scale, freezing the entire blood tsunami mid-crash\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuspending the apocalyptic wave, the nightmare fish, the entire chamber in arctic stillness. They survive through instant tactical coordination and trust.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 832: Endless Thirst and Blessed Solution\r\nThe third floor is a brutal desert with supernatural heat that can't be blocked by barriers. Water doesn't help\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe dungeon imposes thirst that transcends physical dehydration. Caelus swaps to Lingsha for her healing expertise. She determines standard blessing can't counter the imposed state, but Unified form gives her unlimited capability. In merged consciousness, they realize the solution: blessing-enhanced hydration delivered through intimate contact. They must kiss repeatedly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dher saliva carrying divine power that actually cures the supernatural thirst. Mortified but pragmatic, they maintain survival through continuous \"moisture transfer.\" They search the desert for weeks (time is unstable), fighting occasional monsters, cycling the embarrassing cure every thirty minutes. Eventually they find stairs hidden under sand.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 833: Endless Searching and Necessary Intimacy\r\nCaelus and Lingsha continue searching the desert in Unified form, his divine wings carrying them while she scans for anomalies. Every thirty minutes they land to refresh the blessing-enhanced hydration through sustained kissing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe only cure for supernatural thirst. The treatment becomes routine despite mortification: \"medical necessity,\" \"intimate moisture transfer,\" \"definitely not romantic.\" They fight hostile desert creatures, each battle accelerating dehydration and requiring immediate refresh. After what feels like weeks of systematic searching and continuous embarrassing treatment, they finally discover stairs hidden under sand. Both agree to never speak of their desert survival strategy again. They descend to the fourth floor: a massive maze with complex puzzles and comfortable temperature\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno immediate environmental threat.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 834: Vigilant Protection and Sister's Intelligence\r\nCaelus wakes after deep rest to find Lingsha had stayed awake the entire time, having killed a bat monster that threatened him. She explains she'll rest when transformed back to keychain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe suspended state provides dreamless sleep. Grateful, Caelus thanks her for protecting him and surviving the desert together through their mortifying solution. They share an embrace, acknowledging their private shared memories. He swaps to Liora for her strategic mind suited to puzzle-solving. Liora immediately reveals she's been semi-conscious during keychain state\u00e2\u20ac\u201dher brain still processing despite physical suspension. She was close to breaking the dungeon's restriction entirely. She'll crack the seal next time and free everyone permanently, ending the one-person-at-a-time limitation. They enter the maze together.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 835: Ancient Puzzles and Forgotten History\r\nLiora easily solves the entrance puzzle\u00e2\u20ac\u201dseven-stage magical lock. They progress through increasingly complex challenges combining physical manipulation, magical channeling, time pressure, and ancient riddles. Hours pass. Then they reach a corridor covered in six-thousand-year-old carved reliefs telling an unknown story in ancient demonic script. Liora translates: two demon lords born to the weak Ashenclaw tribe\u00e2\u20ac\u201da powerful warrior brother and a gentle lunar demon sister. The tribe valued only the brother's strength, dismissing the sister's healing and care. As the brother conquered territories and absorbed tribes, becoming increasingly powerful and violent, the sister grew more depressed, mourning not just the dead but her brother's transformation. They realize: this is Valthor's erased origin story, and his sister has been systematically removed from all historical records.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 836: Civil War and Erasure\r\nThe narrative continues: the sister confronted Valthor, begging him to stop the conquest, but he couldn't\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis power required constant warfare. She left and created \"Lunarmoon Mercy,\" an underground network offering refuge to demons who refused conscription, who wanted peace over dominance. This revolutionary concept terrified existing power structures. Valthor's forces declared it rebellion and waged civil war\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsystematically destroying the network, scattering followers, hunting the sister. She spent three thousand years hiding, resisting non-violently, barely surviving while Valthor pivoted to wage war against humanity as an external enemy to unite Hell. Her attacks never quite succeeded in killing her\u00e2\u20ac\u201dValthor allowed hunting but prevented actual death. She became weaker, more helpless, eventually disappearing from history completely while still technically alive. The panels show her as a fading shadow, lunar symbols nearly extinguished\u00e2\u20ac\u201da figure erased from history.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 837: Three Millennia and Hidden Observation\r\nThe next puzzle reveals three thousand years of complete hiding after Valthor began the war with humanity. The sister went into deep concealment, officially recorded as dead, reduced to a ghostly observer watching demon lords rise and fall, unable to intervene without revealing herself. Until seventeen years ago: she learned the demon royal court sent assassins to kill the Succubus Demon Lord. She hesitated to interfere\u00e2\u20ac\u201drevealing herself meant capture, eternal imprisonment, being caged as leverage. She planned to stay hidden. But she followed Liora anyway, watched her flee to Clearwater Village disguised as a child. Saw six-year-old Caelus offer three rice balls to the scared demon. Watched him cry over accidentally hitting her with his wooden sword while Liora laughed. That simple moment of kindness shattered the sister's three-thousand-year numbness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe wept, realizing peace and love could still exist.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 838: Seventeen Years' Blood and Liberation\r\nThe final puzzle shows the sister's decision: she vowed to protect Liora, to prove peace and love still exist through their relationship. In one night, she eliminated every assassination threat, solving problems that should have taken months. But doing so revealed she was alive\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproving Valthor's erased sister existed and was interfering. The consequence: she walked voluntarily into the Great Dungeon, choosing eternal imprisonment over watching Liora die and kindness prove meaningless. She never regretted this choice. The puzzle complete, they find her prison chamber\u00e2\u20ac\u201dblood-soaked stone, seventeen years of continuous bleeding. She's chained and impaled through the chest with a massive spike, still conscious, suffering but unbroken. Caelus immediately shatters her chains and dissolves the stone. They carry her to a clean alcove. She speaks her name for the first time in three millennia: Aelenor. She's Valthor's erased sister, and she's so happy to finally have friends who know her story.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 839: Returning Life and Divine Mercy\r\nAs Aelenor talks with them, her eyes transform from dead red to vibrant, living crimson\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvisual proof her spirit is healing after millennia of erasure. She warns floors 5-7 are designed to kill anyone who passes the tests, not challenge them. Liora helps her change from blood-soaked rags into clean clothes. Both demon lords tease Caelus for his embarrassment at turning away, calling him \"baby\" and \"little hero.\" When he protests he's twenty-three and an adult, they burst into laughter\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAelenor's first genuine laugh in three thousand years. Exhausted, she sleeps peacefully for the first time in millennia, surrounded by trusted people. Liora explains Aelenor's name: \"Ae-elenor\" means \"Divine Mercy\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcelestial compassion made manifest, light that reveals truth through unconditional care. She's not just a compassionate person but compassion itself given demonic form\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fundamental force that couldn't be destroyed despite erasure, torture, and millennia of suppression. As long as mercy exists as a concept, she survives.\r\n\r\n# Chapter Summaries\r\n\r\n## Chapter 840: The Weight of Ancient Deaths, Coordinated Swaps, and the Mountain That Fell From Heaven\r\nCaelus, Aelenor, and Liora descend to the fifth floor\u00e2\u20ac\u201da massive colosseum filled with hundreds of dead demon warriors preserved by the dungeon. The warriors attack, forcing intense combat. Caelus uses coordinated keychain swaps (Celestine\u00e2\u2020\u2019Robin\u00e2\u2020\u2019Lingsha) to adapt tactics. With 50 blessing stacks, Dawn Blessing, and Unified Capability, Caelus and Lingsha summon a mountain-sized sword that obliterates all 400+ ancient warriors. Exhausted but victorious, they rest before facing the sixth floor.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 841: The Weight of Forgotten War, Held Hands, and the Sister Who Refused to Yield\r\nResting after battle, Caelus comforts Aelenor about facing the traumatic sixth floor. They descend into a reconstruction of Hell's civil war\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwitnessing Lunarmoon Mercy's systematic destruction by Valthor's forces. Hidden as observers, they watch thousands of Aelenor's followers being slaughtered. Caelus holds Aelenor's hand throughout, grounding her through the horror of reliving her greatest failure and the genocide of everyone who believed in her ideals of peace.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 842: The Weight of Final Sacrifice, Black Blood, and the Smile That Defied Annihilation\r\nThe civil war reconstruction shows Past-Aelenor fighting desperately to save her followers while Past-Valthor systematically breaks her body. Her followers sacrifice themselves to throw her unconscious body into a river, escaping Valthor's capture. Valthor then genocidally erases every remaining Lunarmoon follower\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe blood turns black from the scale of killing. Present-Aelenor breaks down witnessing this. Caelus comforts her with ridiculous stories (pig births, criminal chickens) that somehow help her laugh through the grief.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 843: The Weight of Empty Thrones, Broadcast Swaps, and the Declaration That Damned Two Worlds\r\nThe seventh floor is Valthor's throne room during his coronation as first Demon King. Through broadcast magic, Past-Valthor declares war on Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot from hatred, but as calculated strategy to give Hell an external enemy and prevent internal civil war. Caelus and Aelenor witness the moment that began 3,000 years of human suffering. Solareth's curse triggers, flooding Caelus with visions of a million deaths stemming from this declaration. He hemorrhages blood from the neurological overload.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 844: The Weight of Origins, Borrowed Curses, and the Kiss That Took His Death\r\nCaelus collapses from curse overload. Aelenor uses the forbidden technique she created 5,000 years ago\u00e2\u20ac\u201dkissing him to steal the curse temporarily onto herself. She experiences all million deaths Solareth carved into his mind, including Caelus's own death at Lumora (Valthor reaching into his chest, stopping his heart). The curse breaks something fundamental in Aelenor, but she endures it to save him. Caelus survives; Aelenor is devastated but refuses to let him carry this burden alone anymore.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 845: The Weight of Empty Thrones, Prophetic Echoes, and the Sister Who Finally Broke Free\r\nPast-Valthor reveals himself as an echo with temporary awareness. He explains his 6,000-year plan: become the villain both worlds unite against, teaching them peace through shared trauma. The war ends only when he's killed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproof that love defeats calculated violence. When Caelus kills the echo once, the dungeon's rules weaken. Bahamut breaks through from outside, demolishing the ceiling for rescue. Valthor surrenders, declaring Caelus victorious. Caelus only wants wheat for noodles and fish for Bahamut\u00e2\u20ac\u201drejecting material treasure because \"family cares if you're alive, not what you bring home.\"\r\n\r\n## Chapter 846: The Weight of Waking, Strategic Hope, and the Promise of Noodles That Defied Kings\r\nCaelus wakes after the curse assault, surrounded by his freed family (Liora broke the keychain curse through soul bonds). He explains Valthor's \"Sovereign's Ascension\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpower from collective acknowledgment across two worlds making him functionally immortal. But they can win through unity vs. his isolation. Robin and Lingsha had experienced half the curse through soul bond. Before leaving, Valthor's echo gives them wheat and fish. Caelus promises Aelenor a proper noodle festival feast once they escape, prioritizing celebration over trauma processing.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 847: The Weight of Fifty Stacks, Shared Nosebleeds, and the Dance That Compressed Eternity\r\nThe final trial begins\u00e2\u20ac\u201dHero Party vs. Valthor's echo. Caelus activates Unified Capability with Robin (merged consciousness). Lingsha provides 50 blessing stacks; Celestine adds Dawn Blessing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth hemorrhage from overexertion. Liora casts Shared Torment (forcing Valthor to experience Solareth's million deaths). Aelenor activates Lunar Sovereignty (environmental control). All women get nosebleeds from magical strain. In compressed time perception (1 second = 3 hours awareness), they fight at impossible speeds, matching Valthor through perfect coordination despite him being overwhelmingly stronger individually.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 848: The Weight of Accumulated Damage, Dragon-Sized Holes, and the Treasure That Mattered Most\r\nThe coordinated assault accumulates mental damage on Valthor through Liora's technique. Caelus uses stealth and 15 golden swords to impale him during an ultimate magic activation. Divine arrows from Celestine/Lingsha strike. Caelus decapitates Valthor's echo, confirming one death. The dungeon shakes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dexternal intervention becomes possible. Bahamut demolishes the ceiling for rescue. Valthor surrenders: \"You won.\" Caelus rejects treasure, wanting only wheat (for noodles) and fish (for Bahamut), proving family matters more than wealth. The trial ends; they escape on Bahamut toward home.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 849: The Weight of Dragon Meals, Rejected Wealth, and the Night That Would Come Too Soon\r\nBahamut eats massive fish with satisfaction while Caelus secures wheat for noodles. Valthor's echo offers unlimited treasure\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgold, weapons, artifacts. Caelus refuses: \"Family is people who care if you're alive, not what you bring home.\" This perfectly answers the 6,000-year question about choosing connection over accumulation. The echo smiles, satisfied, and dissolves. Flying home on Bahamut, Caelus becomes vulnerable\u00e2\u20ac\u201dasking his family to stay with him through the incoming Solareth payment curse. They promise: \"We will always stay with you. No need to ask.\"\r\n\r\n## Chapter 850: The Weight of Waiting Hours, Shared Privilege, and the Night That Refused Loneliness\r\nIn Kronos's domain chamber, Caelus sits terrified waiting for Solareth's curse payment (1 hour until it hits). Robin and Lingsha flank him, holding his hands\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey'll experience half his pain through soul bond. They call it \"the privilege of loving you\" not \"consequences.\" Aelenor offers to take the curse again; Caelus refuses, not wanting her to suffer more. His family forms a protective circle. Robin: \"Being alive is enough.\" They prepare to weather the million-death visions together, proving through presence that isolation can be defeated by simply staying.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 851: The Weight of Morning Preparations, Dragon Arrivals, and the Hand That Carried Six Thousand Years\r\nSolphire celebrates the Hero Party's return after two weeks. Prince Sunday coordinates massive preparations. Bahamut descends through a dimensional portal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmountain-sized dragon god arriving gently outside city gates. The Hero Party lands carrying wheat sacks, plus a sixth figure: Aelenor (White skin, crimson eyes, obviously demon). Initial fear in crowd. Robin asks citizens to shake Aelenor's hand to understand her directly. Prince Sunday volunteers first\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtouching her hand, he experiences fragments of 6,000 years of revolutionary compassion maintained through genocide and torture. He breaks down crying, understanding her goodness transcends human experience. Citizens follow, one by one accepting her.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 852: The Weight of Royal Chambers, Erased History, and the Sister Who Was First Victim\r\nPrivate briefing in royal living chamber: Robin reveals Aelenor is Valthor's erased sister. King Aldric and Queen Seraphina are shocked\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno historical records exist. Robin and Liora explain Lunarmoon Mercy's founding 5,000 years ago (sanctuary for demons seeking peace). Valthor declared it illegal, systematically genocided every follower\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtens of thousands executed publicly. Final battle: Aelenor's broken body thrown in river by sacrificing followers. Valthor erased all survivors from existence itself. Aelenor breaks down reliving it. Queen Seraphina embraces her: \"Your followers weren't wrong to trust you.\" The royals accept her completely, understanding her suffering predates humanity's war.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 853: The Weight of Commander's Grief, Earned Peace, and the Ears That Tasted Like Sausage\r\nSunday briefs Commanders Astraea, William, and Gareth about Aelenor's history. Commander William (who lost wife and children to Valthor) breaks down\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot with hatred, but with compassion. He recognizes Aelenor's suffering dwarfs his own: \"I couldn't hate her. She stood by her ideals for 6,000 years while suffering every consequence.\" All commanders accept her as family and teacher. Observing from afar: Aelenor's ears are bright red with small bite marks. Astraea laughs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsleeping Caelus probably mistook her ears for sausages and bit them. \"Our hero's dreams are full of sausages and fish. There's no third option.\"\r\n\r\n## Chapter 854: The Weight of Blue Authority, Six Thousand Years, and the Bow That Promised Survival\r\n3,000 soldiers assembled for demonstration. Aelenor activates \"Lunarmoon Accession(Adh\u00c3\u00a9sion \u00c3\u00a0 Lunarmoon)\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dultimate magic turning everything within her domain blue and under absolute control. Every soldier feels primal terror; their weapons transform (become heavy, liquid, powder) proving conventional warfare is useless. Caelus explains demon lord ultimate magic principles and announces next week's assessment against Aelenor (6,000 years combat experience vs. human decades). Aelenor reveals her techniques to help them survive, then BOWS to the soldiers: \"Please work with me. Let's survive together.\" All 3,000 soldiers bow back in respect. Revolutionary cooperation\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddemon lord teaching humans to contest her own brother.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 855: The Weight of Blue Authority, Six Thousand Years, and the Bow That Promised Survival\r\n[Note: This appears to be a duplicate/continuation of Chapter 854 in the source document]\r\n\r\nThree princes (Sunday, Aldric, Wales) coordinate in Sunday's office. The purge is complete: all 2,735 conspirators executed across kingdoms. They discuss the weekend assessment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoldiers will fight a true ancient demon lord (Aelenor) whose capability approaches Valthor's. The moral weight: she's teaching them to kill her own brother. Sunday: \"We prove her right\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat her 6,000 years of believing in peace wasn't meaningless.\" They can only provide support and trust the soldiers will rise to meet the impossible. The assessment will test whether human coordination can contest 6,000 years of demon lord experience.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 856: The Weight of Market Rituals, Stolen Tradition, and the Smile That Broke Six Thousand Years\r\nAfter training, Caelus drags Aelenor to the market\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshowing his \"everyday important stuff.\" He selects vegetables with tactical precision (annoying vendors). Aelenor carries a massive salmon, marked by its smell as part of his domestic ritual. They visit the temple to collect Celestine and Lingsha. Sister Mira teases: Caelus has a pattern of \"stealing\" High Priestesses\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtook Lingsha, then Celestine, both now Hero Party members. She jokes about being too old to be stolen. Sister Mira takes Aelenor's hand, praises her beauty restored after 6,000 years of suffering. Caelus calls Aelenor \"like a lunar eclipse\u00e2\u20ac\u201delegant and rare.\" First genuine compliment about her appearance in 6,000 years. Aelenor cries with joy, smiling devastatingly. All three cry witnessing her happiness.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 857: The Weight of Royal Coordination, Executed Conspirators, and the Teacher Who Would Fight Her Brother's Throne\r\nThree princes coordinate final assessment logistics. Discussion of moral weight: Aelenor teaching humans to kill her own brother. Sunday: \"We must support her decision completely\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprove peace and love are possible.\" They review Aelenor's revelation of ultimate magic (demon lords guard these with their lives). Logistics finalized: observation platforms, medical teams, security perimeter. Core concern: soldiers fighting apex-class demon lord (Valthor's sister) is exponentially more dangerous than demon lord candidates. Ultimately they can only trust the soldiers' psychological readiness and believe their doctrine built on love can contest even this impossible opponent.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 858: The Weight of Perfect Teachers, Hidden Ghosts, and the Victory That Ended in Dishes\r\nSafety protocol test: Caelus vs. Aelenor with Celestine providing blessing support. Aelenor teaches while fighting\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcorrecting footwork, predicting attacks, demonstrating 6,000-year mastery. Caelus uses perfect stealth in tree cluster\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecomes completely undetectable even to her ancient awareness. When she starts ultimate magic activation, Caelus drops from directly above (blind spot during activation), tackling her in a \"victory hug\" instead of killing strike. Aelenor laughs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dperfect execution ruined by refusing to finish opponents. \"That was death in real combat.\" Caelus: \"Family doesn't decapitate each other. New tradition: victory hugs.\" Since Aelenor \"lost,\" she handles dish duty tonight. Protocols confirmed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus can intervene fast enough to protect soldiers. That night: amazing cheesy shrimp, and Aelenor washes dishes smiling, because losing here means belonging.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 859: The Weight of Divine Intervention, Sausage Dreams, and the Wings That Demanded Breakfast**\r\nAelenor wakes up to find Caelus sleep-nibbling her ear, believing it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sausage in his dream. The other women\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLiora, Robin, Celestine, and Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtease her about it. Despite her embarrassment, Aelenor realizes she cherishes this warm, chaotic closeness after millennia of loneliness. Caelus wakes, mortified, and uses his divine wings to cheat at rock-paper-scissors to win bathroom priority, blaming his wings for wanting to cook breakfast. The morning is filled with laughter and familial chaos before they prepare for the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military assessment.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 860: The Weight of Bitten Ears, Medical Protocols, and the Instructor Who Couldn't Stop Blushing**\r\nBefore the assessment, Caelus, Lingsha, and Celestine review medical protocols with Sister Mira, who discovers Aelenor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ear has bite marks. The embarrassing story spreads, and soon the entire camp knows Caelus mistook Aelenor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears for sausages in his sleep. Aelenor, blushing deeply, tries to maintain her composure as the instructor for the day. Despite the teasing, the mood remains warm and familial as everyone prepares for the demonstration.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 861: The Weight of Blue Authority, Counted Minutes, and the Autonomy That Refused to Kneel**\r\nAelenor begins the assessment by allowing the soldiers to attack her for one minute while she corrects their technique. Then she activates **Lunarmoon Accession**, turning the entire area blue and paralyzing everyone with absolute authority. However, many soldiers use blessing stacks to regain partial autonomy, defying her control. Aelenor is moved to see humanity contesting her ultimate magic through discipline and faith\u00e2\u20ac\u201da validation of her revolutionary ideals.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 862: The Weight of Counted Minutes, Blessed Steel, and the Core That Flickered Once**\r\nThe battle intensifies as soldiers coordinate attacks to overwhelm Aelenor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senses. Commander William and Ironshrine Squad wait for an opening, then strike with blessed swords, causing her ultimate magic to flicker briefly upon contact. Though most soldiers lose autonomy as their blessings expire, William and a core group continue fighting. Aelenor escalates the challenge, impressed by their adaptability and resolve.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 863: The Weight of Shattered Steel, Communal Prayer, and the Sword That Answered Solidarity**\r\nAelenor shatters all blessed weapons with her magic, leaving the soldiers defenseless. In response, William and the soldiers join in a **communal prayer**, and their shattered weapons reform into a single massive golden greatsword\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe **Sword of Divine Prayer**. With it, they strike Aelenor, disrupting her ultimate magic for several seconds. Though exhausted and weaponless afterward, they triumph. Aelenor collapses from exhaustion and is caught by Caelus, who teases her about smelling like burnt sausage.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 864: The Weight of Tomato Faces, Medical Precision, and the Sword Named by Scholars**\r\nAelenor is carried to the medical tent, deeply embarrassed. Caelus moves among the soldiers, personally congratulating each for their performance. Sister Mira tends to the exhausted William, who channeled the communal prayer. The princes analyze the battle, formally naming the manifested weapon the **Sword of Divine Prayer**. They recognize it as a powerful but unreplicable tactic\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpossible only through genuine solidarity and desperate faith. The assessment ends with humanity having proven it can contest a demon lord through unity and prayer.\r\n\r\nHere are summaries for each chapter part:\r\n\r\n**Chapter 865: The Weight of Numb Hands, Answered Grief, and the Goddess Who Watched All Along**\r\nCommander William awakens in the medical tent after channeling the Sword of Divine Prayer. His body is numb, but Commander Astraea visits him, and they discuss how his eight years of grief and vengeance have been guided by Solara all along. William realizes his suffering had purpose\u00e2\u20ac\u201dleading him to learn communal prayer and solidarity, transforming his loss into strength that can challenge Valthor. He weeps with gratitude, finally understanding that the goddess was watching and guiding him toward a new family and a chance to honor his dead wife and children.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 866: The Weight of Lumora Pigeons, Princess Promises, and the Wedding That Would Conquer Obliviousness**\r\nA pigeon delivers a personal letter from Princess Elara to Robin. Elara reveals she is pregnant, thanks Robin for teaching her pregnancy prevention magic, and credits Robin with saving her life from the Damazti parasite. She offers Valcrest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full support for Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future wedding(s) to Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmultiple ceremonies if needed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand promises to help create the most spectacular wedding celebration. Robin is moved, tearfully imagining the chaotic ceremony where Caelus will likely propose while discussing fish care, completely oblivious to the romantic significance.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 867: The Weight of Blank Episodes, Accumulated Exhaustion, and the Vacation That Prioritized Others First**\r\nAfter the assessment, the princes and Robin finalize reports. Prince Aldric reaffirms Valcrest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to support Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wedding. Meanwhile, Caelus suffers a blank episode (a neurological symptom from Solareth curse damage) and collapses in the market. Aelenor catches him and brings him to the temple. The women, concerned about his severe exhaustion from two months of non-stop teaching, decide to force him on a vacation to Lumora. Caelus only agrees when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s framed as a chance for Aelenor to experience peace for the first time in millennia.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 868: The Weight of Enforced Rest, Gentle Fever, and the Hero Who Dreamed of Feasts Instead of Weddings**\r\nThe women successfully administer a sleep herb to Caelus, forcing him into deep, restorative sleep. They monitor his therapeutic fever and care for him. While watching him sleep, Lingsha and Celestine discuss the future wedding plans Valcrest has offered. When they mention a \"big party\" in Lumora, Caelus smiles in his sleep\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis subconscious interpreting it as a feast, not a wedding. The women laugh fondly at his oblivious, food-obsessed nature, reaffirming their love for him just as he is.\r\n\r\n**Chapter 869: The Weight of Morning Negotiations, Royal Permissions, and the Journey That Carried Sleeping Heroes**\r\nThe women split duties: Robin secures a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leave from the King, Liora arranges substitutes at the academy, and Aelenor helps gather supplies. They load a still-sleeping Caelus into a royal carriage for a gentle journey to Lumora. Along the way, they share stories of past times they had to force Caelus to rest. Aelenor reflects on her first peaceful entry into a human city as a welcome guest. They arrive in Lumora, where Sister Mira has prepared accommodations by preparing and clean the lingsha high priestess chamber with full accomodation, and the city quietly welcomes its exhausted Hero.\r\n\r\nfrom Chapter 869: The hero family(caelus, lingsha, liora, celestine, robin, and aelenor was in lumora for recovery and vacation)\r\n\r\n# Chapter Summaries: 870-875\r\n\r\n## Chapter 870: The Weight of Pointed Warmth, Sausage Distribution, and the Ears That Surrendered Willingly\r\n\r\nDuring a heavy storm, the Hero Party sleeps together in Lingsha's chamber in Lumora. Aelenor offers to use her ultimate magic to stop the rain, but the women refuse and simply press closer to Caelus for warmth. In his sleep, Caelus dreams about being surrounded by sausages and begins gently nomming Aelenor's pointed ear, believing it's a \"fully cooked pointed sausage.\" The women find this hilarious\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLiora laughs uncontrollably, while Aelenor tolerates it with patient amusement. When Caelus wakes and realizes what he's done, he's mortified, but Aelenor reassures him that being treated as \"part of the family\" (even as breakfast) is a gift after 6,000 years of isolation.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 871: The Weight of Empty Beds, Missing Sheep, and the Girl Who Chased Horizons\r\n\r\nAt the Lumora Children's Sanctuary (built after Valthor's attack), Sister Mira discovers that seven-year-old Mari has run away for the fourth time this month. Mari, a blessed child with strong light magic, had chased a lost sheep named Cloud through a gap in the city wall during last night's storm. Outside the walls, Mari experiences revelation: the world is bigger and greener than the trauma that defined her life. She plays with Cloud in the fields, using her blessing magic to create sparkles and attempting to ride the sheep. Meanwhile, Sister Mira mobilizes a search party and places a guild mission request.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 872: The Weight of Forgotten Holes, Demonic Glares, and the Contractor Who Would Regret Everything\r\n\r\nSister Mira finds the wall gap but gets stuck trying to squeeze through it herself. Aelenor\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwho got lost while shopping for groceries\u00e2\u20ac\u201darrives and pulls her free. When Sister Mira asks for help retrieving Mari, Aelenor suggests destroying the wall to make it larger. Sister Mira agrees, noting the gap represents contractor oversight that needs accountability. Aelenor destroys the section of wall with just a *glare*, using her Lunarmoon authority to crumble stone to dust without even activating her ultimate magic. They proceed through the new archway to search for Mari, with Sister Mira mentally planning a comprehensive city facilities audit.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 873: The Weight of Magical Residue, Forgotten Slimes, and the Two Who Cried for Different Reasons\r\n\r\nAelenor tracks Mari using her ability to read magical residue left by blessing magic. They find Mari\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoaking wet, sneezing, playing with Cloud. When Sister Mira approaches, a dormant slime attacks from the mud. Aelenor stares at it with demonic authority, causing the slime to dissolve back into water out of pure terror. Aelenor then gently touches Mari to check for injuries, but the skin contact triggers Mari's trauma\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe sees Aelenor's demonic features and experiences a flashback to Valthor's attack. Mari screams \"She's Valthor!\" and her blessing magic attacks Aelenor defensively. Though the attacks cause no physical harm, they devastate Aelenor emotionally. Sister Mira calms Mari until she cries from exhaustion and fear. Aelenor stands frozen, tears streaming down her face, repeatedly whispering \"I'm sorry\" because she knows this trauma comes from what her brother did. The chapter ends with two people crying simultaneously: a seven-year-old child and a 6,000-year-old demon lord, while Cloud continues eating grass unbothered.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 874: The Weight of Indirect Touch, Wooden Swords, and the Hero Who Forgot He Was an Adult\r\n\r\nSister Mira carries the sleeping, feverish Mari back to the sanctuary, with Aelenor following and Cloud being led by Sister Hanna. They take Mari to her shared room (Lingsha's regulation: two children per room so they're not alone but not crowded). Sister Mira carefully tends to Mari while Aelenor helps *indirectly*\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpreparing water, selecting clothes, never touching Mari's skin to avoid triggering another flashback. Aelenor spreads the final blanket over Mari as the closest thing to physical care she can offer. Afterward, Aelenor notices the sanctuary is filled with Hero Party memorabilia: toy wooden swords (replicas of Solareth), handmade cloaks, drawings on walls, door keychains shaped like Solareth. Sister Mira explains the children adore Caelus because when he visits, he forgets he's an adult and plays with them completely\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmaking toy swords together, having elaborate battles, teaching \"Hot Pot Hero\" games. Aelenor realizes these traumatized children see the Hero Party\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding her\u00e2\u20ac\u201das proof that good people exist and are worth emulating.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 875: The Weight of Lost Groceries, Nommed Dignity, and the Ears That Would Prove Harmlessness\r\n\r\nAelenor returns to Lingsha's chamber with her groceries after being lost all day. The other four women had been searching the city for her. Aelenor recounts the day's events: getting lost, helping find Mari, the trauma flashback, and the sanctuary. Caelus reassures her that Mari's blessed instincts sensed her *connection* to Valthor but not her harmful intention, and once she proves herself harmless, Mari will find her interesting\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust like how Mari trusts Liora despite her being a demon lord. The conversation devolves into teasing about Caelus nomming Aelenor's ears while sleeping. Robin suggests they visit the sanctuary tomorrow and show the children a *sketch she drew* of the ear-nomming incident to prove Aelenor is harmless. Liora adds that Aelenor \"let her dignity be eaten by an oblivious hero for an entire night without fighting back\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvery harmless demon lord.\" Despite the embarrassment, Aelenor feels profound belonging in this chaotic family that teases her trauma away while promising to help her connect with the children. They all sleep together in a warm pile, with Aelenor learning that love means being kept despite\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand because of\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe absurd parts.\r\n\r\n# Chapter Summaries: 876-882\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 876: The Weight of First Sanctuary Visits, Kitchen Chaos, and the Ears That Proved Safety\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nThe Hero Party's first formal visit to the Children's Sanctuary after Aelenor's traumatic encounter with Mari. Caelus leads the family to the market to purchase ingredients, teaching Aelenor how to navigate Lumora's streets. At the sanctuary, the children are at school, so the group prepares a feast in the kitchen with assigned stations (Robin: precision work, Lingsha: stove management, Celestine: learning/assisting, Liora: ingredient organization, Aelenor: vegetable prep with uniform 1cm cubes). When children return, they swarm Caelus enthusiastically\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsome nom his hair because it smells like cooking. Caelus demonstrates Aelenor's ears are safe by gently biting them, encouraging children to touch. Mari makes her first contact with Aelenor, touching her ear tip and asking \"Did it hurt when the hero bit your ears?\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshowing concern rather than fear. This marks Mari's first step toward accepting Aelenor.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 877: The Weight of Evening Strolls, Flower Conversations, and the Goddess Who Welcomed Demons\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nEvening after the first sanctuary visit. The Hero Party walks to the Irish Fountain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe sacred site where Caelus died fighting Valthor and where impossible iris flowers bloom from his blood. Caelus speaks to Solara through a picked iris flower, giving conversational updates including the children's recovery progress and introducing Aelenor: \"new family... kind... spent 6000 years being brave alone... 17 years tortured... worth saving.\" Wind responds (Solara's presence), and flowers dance in welcome. Aelenor experiences divine acceptance for the first time. Discussion of \"golden donut\" (children's term for Caelus's halo) becomes a running joke. The family bonds over shared sacred space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 878: The Weight of Clearwater Memories, Wooden Birds, and the Observer Who Chose Imprisonment\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nSecond sanctuary visit\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus is therapeutically sedated by Robin for mandatory rest. Robin stays as guard while Lingsha, Celestine, Liora, and Aelenor visit the sanctuary alone. Aelenor conducts a storytelling session with the quiet/watcher children, sharing her history: Lunarmoon Mercy sanctuary, 3000 years of hiding, and the Clearwater Village observation. **Critical backstory revealed:** Aelenor was a silent OBSERVER 17 years ago, watching from shadows as Liora (disguised child demon being hunted) received rice balls from 6-year-old Caelus. Aelenor eliminated all assassins hunting Liora in one night, revealing her location to Valthor's forces. She chose capture/torture to protect the village and the kindness she witnessed. She never met Caelus or Liora until the dungeon rescue. The wooden bird pendant she wears was given by Caelus to Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAelenor wears it as a symbol of witnessed kindness worth protecting. Mari joins the storytelling circle, sits beside Aelenor (not touching but proximate), and promises to hug her \"tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 879: The Weight of Morning Routines, Hiding Heroes, and the Breakfast That Carried Memories\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nMorning chapter focusing on the Hero Party's domestic dynamics. Caelus hides in the closet during family bathing/changing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis ongoing mortification at their casual intimacy. The women tease him about his hiding locations escalating. Family prepares for third sanctuary visit. Caelus unconsciously hums while cooking\u00e2\u20ac\u201da behavior from his childhood that makes Liora emotional (she recognizes it from 17 years ago). The chapter establishes the comfortable chaos of their morning routines and Caelus's continued struggle with accepting the intimacy his family offers freely.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 880: The Weight of Hide and Seek, Forgotten Gardens, and the Girl Who Knew Where to Look\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nThird sanctuary visit. Morning: Caelus hides in closet during family changing (again). At the sanctuary, the group prepares another feast with all six members cooking together. A reversed hide-and-seek game is organized: Aelenor hides, children seek. Rules: 5 minutes hiding, 30 minutes seeking, winners get \"beautiful gift.\" Aelenor hides in a forgotten courtyard garden (overgrown, unused)\u00e2\u20ac\u201da space that mirrors her own history of being forgotten. Mari finds her first through psychological insight, reasoning: \"She's somewhere beautiful that needs to be remembered, like her.\" Before other children arrive, Mari and Aelenor share a profound moment. Mari says: \"You waited 3000 years for someone to find you. Being found by one person who was looking matters.\" Aelenor cries happy tears. Mari announces her discovery, and other children flood the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 881: The Weight of Divine Wings, Touching Sunshine, and the Sky That Held Everyone\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nThe \"beautiful gift\" is revealed: Caelus offers to fly everyone. He enters his \"true divine form\" but gentle version\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgolden wings (living beings, responsive, warm), spinning halo, no oppressive presence, only love/warmth. Wings become soft \"like bird feathers.\" Children touch wings first, describing it as \"like being hugged by sunshine\" and \"like the hero is everywhere at once.\" Wings respond with pleased rustling. Individual flights commence: Mari flies first (priority as winner), learning \"the sky is big enough to hold scary things so they can't touch you.\" Golden feathers fall during flights. All 47 children fly, then staff (Sister Mira, Elder Marcus weeping), then Hero Party \"for joy not necessity.\" Aelenor flies last, side-by-side hold, Caelus declares \"Now you're family.\" Sister Mira's insight: \"You showed them power can be gentle, that divine presence from their nightmare can also be warmth that carries them through healing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Chapter 882: The Weight of Forced Feeding, Sleeping Piles, and the Gratitude That Needed No Words\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nEvening after the flights. The family forces Caelus to eat properly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe tends to forget his own needs while caring for others. Robin and Lingsha coordinate a \"pincer movement\" to ensure he consumes adequate food. The proprietor of their dining establishment serves multiple courses and refuses payment (his nephew caught a golden feather and now sleeps peacefully). Return to Lingsha's chamber: the group is too tired for bathing rotation. **Sleeping pile formation established:** Robin atop Caelus's chest, Lingsha at his right side, Aelenor behind Lingsha, Celestine at his left side, Liora behind Celestine. Aelenor's internal realization while watching sleeping Caelus: gratitude is presence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstaying, choosing, being family. She decides to stay \"all the days after that.\" The chapter concludes the day's events with emphasis on the family's interconnected rest.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Weight of Reversed Gifts, Children's Orchestration, and the Kisses That Painted Cheeks Red** : Chapter 883\r\n\r\nThe sanctuary children surprise the Hero Party with a full day of planned activities to show their appreciation. Mari leads the \"official welcome\" wearing a handmade ceremonial sash. Activities include \"Hero Appreciation Circle\" (where each child shares what the Hero Party means to them), games like \"Protect the Hero's Snacks\" and \"Dress the Moon Lady,\" a theatrical performance of the Hero Party's adventures, and a shared lunch prepared by the children themselves. The day concludes with all forty-seven children kissing Caelus's cheeks as thanks for the previous day's flying experience, leaving him blushing but genuinely happy. The children's name cards assign nicknames: Caelus as \"HERO (also donut),\" Aelenor as \"MOON LADY (also sad but getting better).\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Weight of Evening Walks, Quiet Questions, and the Fountain That Witnessed Healing** : Chapter 884\r\n\r\nThe women deliberately leave Caelus and Aelenor without tasks, forcing them to \"enjoy the evening.\" They walk to the Irish Fountain where Caelus asks Aelenor how she's truly doing. She confesses her fear that the happiness will disappear, her guilt over three thousand years of hiding while others suffered, and her exhaustion from waiting for punishment that usually follows anything good. Caelus shares his own struggles with accepting care and believing he deserves good things. Aelenor reveals she spent three thousand years watching a plague village die because revealing herself meant capture. Caelus reframes her sacrifice\u00e2\u20ac\u201dher one night of action protecting Liora rippled forward to enable everything they're building now. They hold hands (not romantically, but as connection between two damaged people) and agree to walk together again tomorrow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Weight of Sunday Prayers, First Participations, and the Temple That Welcomed Everyone** : Chapter 885\r\n\r\nSunday morning temple day in Lumora. Lingsha and Celestine lead formal prayer service in their High Priestess robes. Aelenor attends her first-ever religious service in six thousand years of existence, terrified of doing something wrong. During personal prayer time, Solara speaks directly to Aelenor, welcoming her and saying she is \"exactly what I hoped demons could be.\" Celestine delivers a special address acknowledging Aelenor's presence, declaring her welcome \"now and always.\" The congregation applauds, accepting the ancient demon lord without reservation. The sanctuary children participate enthusiastically (one prays about breakfast). Mari tells Aelenor \"The heart learns\" about accepting good things. Aelenor says her first \"Amen\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dher first formal participation in human religious ritual.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Weight of Midnight Skies, Falling Stars, and the Family That Found Each Other** : Chapter 886\r\n\r\nHeavy rainstorm clears around 11 PM. Caelus can't sleep and extracts himself from the sleeping pile; Robin (wearing his oversized white shirt) automatically follows. They discover a spectacular meteor shower\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe clearest, most intense either has seen. Caelus wakes the others; they travel to the temple rooftop (highest point in Lumora) to watch together. The stone is wet, the city dark, the sky brilliant with falling stars. Each person shares their wish: Celestine wishes for more peaceful moments together; Caelus wishes for time with his family; Liora's old wish for \"something to live for\" came true beyond imagination; Lingsha wishes for this moment to last long enough to remember; Aelenor says she doesn't need to wish anymore\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\"everything I ever wished for is standing right here.\" Caelus finally says \"I love you\" to all of them directly. They stay until dawn, then return to sleep as a family. **The Lumora arc concludes**\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAelenor found belonging, the Hero Party found joy without earning it, and the sanctuary children learned heroes are human enough to love.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Weight of Revealed Truth, Sovereign Ascension, and the Fear That Fed the Enemy** : Chapter 887\r\n\r\nMonday in Solphire. Sunday reflects that the Hero Party has been in Lumora for a week. He and Helena proceed to the training ground for a major revelation to three thousand soldiers. Sunday and Astraea reveal intelligence from Aelenor's report: Valthor possesses TWO ultimate magics (unprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven Kronos and Aelenor can only have one). The first is \"Sovereign Ascension\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan innate, passive magic active since birth. Every instance of fear directed at Valthor makes him stronger with no upper limit. This explains his rise from minor demon lord to Demon King in under 1,000 years (5,000 years ago), and why three millennia of human fear has made him seemingly omnipotent and immortal. The chapter ends with soldiers in despair, realizing that fearing Valthor strengthens him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut how can you NOT fear something omnipotent? Astraea's final words: \"Valthor is omnipotent and immortal because of this.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Weight of Redirected Fear, Divine Frameworks, and the Hope That Replaced Despair** : Chapter 888\r\n\r\nContinuation of the briefing. Astraea smiles (like William's \"found new strategy\" smile) and asks soldiers who created the Sword of Divine Prayer how they felt during manifestation. They answer: not afraid\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey felt STRONGER than ever despite logically having already lost. William describes hearing each individual prayer giving him strength. Sunday and Astraea explain: the Sword operates on faith, not fear\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit doesn't feed Valthor. Requirements: learn about enemies BEFORE meeting them (knowledge over terror), and their doctrine still works (Aelenor confirmed Valthor CAN bleed and be killed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey just don't know how many resurrections he has). Helena reads the winning scenarios from Prince Wales's summit strategy: (1) kill/immobilize Valthor causing demon retreat, OR (2) kill every demon in his army leaving him no reason to govern. Fundamental requirement: never let Valthor regroup with his army. Soldiers remember making Aelenor's ultimate magic FLICKER during assessment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproof they can destabilize demon lord magic. New directive: redirect fear from Valthor to ANYTHING else (instructors, spiders, puppies, undercooked chicken). William declares: \"The second time I face him, I am ready and will destroy his throne!\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Weight of Reversed Terror, Trained Defiance, and the Army That Learned to Be Feared** : Chapter 889\r\n\r\nFirst day of psychological restructuring training. The training ground features a massive board titled \"THINGS WE FEAR MORE THAN VALTHOR\" with hundreds of soldier contributions (Commander Astraea's disappointed face, undercooked chicken, spiders, disappointing the goddess, etc.). Training emphasizes making soldiers fear their INSTRUCTORS more than the Demon King. Gareth demands perfect formation with terrifying consequences for failure. William leads prayer coordination drills teaching soldiers to transform personal fear into determination and unity. Astraea demonstrates impossible combat sequences, then uses DISAPPOINTMENT as motivation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoldiers fear failing in front of the Hero's memory more than they fear death. Evening assessment reveals unexpected development: soldiers aren't just redirecting fear, they're becoming ANGRY at Valthor. They want him to PAY for six thousand years of feeding on terror. Sunday decides to encourage this righteous hatred. The psychological framework is working\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfacing Valthor now feels abstract while facing instructors feels immediately terrifying.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Weight of Homecoming, Redirected Anger, and the Sister Who Finally Had Company** : Chapter 890\r\n\r\nHero Party returns from Lumora vacation. Caelus and Aelenor go directly to the training grounds while others scatter to their duties. In the command tent, Sunday and Astraea brief them on the soldiers' psychological transformation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuccessful fear redirection plus unexpected emergence of genuine anger/hatred toward Valthor. Caelus is happy that \"the students passed their fear.\" Aelenor LAUGHS with genuine delight and reveals crucial context: for FIVE THOUSAND YEARS since Valthor claimed the throne, she was the ONLY being in two worlds who was truly MAD at him rather than afraid. Everyone else feared, respected, dreaded\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut only Aelenor carried righteous fury. Now, finally, she has COMPANY. Three thousand soldiers have chosen anger over fear, hatred of tyranny over terror of power. Aelenor calls this \"worth more than any tactical advantage\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's shared hope, distributed across an army that has decided five thousand years of accumulated terror ends with them. She's no longer alone in her anger.

Android menempati pangsa pasar tertinggi di seluruh dunia. Aplikasi untuk Android dikembangkan dengan menggunakan 2 teknik, yaitu *native* dan *hybrid*.\n\nAplikasi *native* adalah aplikasi yang dikembangkan secara langsung untuk dijalankan secara langsung dengan menggunakan ART (*Android Runtime*).\n\nAplikasi *hybrid* menyertakan *browser engine* di dalam aplikasi. *Browser engine* tersebut berfungsi untuk menghasilkan tampilan berbasis spesifikasi teknologi Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Guna mendapatkan akses aras/level rendah/sistem, aplikasi *hybrid* menggunakan perangkat pembantu yang disebut *Native API plugins*.\n\nSalah satu *framework* yang dapat digunakan untuk mengembangkan aplikasi *hybrid* adalah Ionic. Ionic memungkinkan seseorang pengembang aplikasi untuk dapat membangun aplikasi dengan menggunakan spesifikasi teknologi *Web* serta memakai *framework* antarmuka Angular, React, atau Vue; dengan menggunakan JavaScript dan/atau TypeScript sebagai bahasa pemrograman untuk Ionic.\n\n## 1.2\n\n\nTypeScript adalah bahasa pemrograman yang merupakan superset dari JavaScript. TypeScript mengenali dan dapat memproses sintaksis JavaScript. TypeScript melakukan berbagai penambahan pada sintaksis JavaScript sehingga berbagai kelemahan JavaScript yang selama ini menjadi keluhan dari berbagai pengembangan perangkat lunak dapat diperbaiki.\n\nKode sumber TypeScript akan dikompilasi menjadi JavaScript yang dapat dijalankan dengan menggunakan Node.js. Kompilator TypeScript dapat digunakan untuk mengompilasi kode sumber JavaScript maupun TypeScript.\n\nSebagai suatu bahasa pemrograman, TypeScript juga mempunyai konstruksi tersendiri yang sebenarnya merupakan perluasan dari JavaScript. Beberapa hal yang diubah dan diperbaiki dari JavaScript antara lain adalah penggunaan static typing dalam kode sumber, berbagai tipe data, penggunaan let dan variable scoping, OOP, interface, serta fasilitas modul. Kegiatan belajar ini mempelajari berbagai sintaks dan konstruksi dasar dari TypeScript, terutama bagian-bagian yang membedakan dengan JavaScript.\n\n## 1.3 \n\nAsynchronous programming atau non-blocking I/O adalah teknik pemrograman untuk mengantisipasi kemungkinan akan terjadi atau tidak terjadi sesuatu hal pada saat yang akan datang serta untuk mengerjakan proses secara konkuren jika dirasakan latensi untuk bagian tertentu akan signifikan (antara lain karena akses I/O). TypeScript mengantisipasi kedua hal tersebut dengan menggunakan konstruksi Promise serta async/await.\n\nSuatu aplikasi pada umumnya terdiri atas sisi client/frontend maupun server/backend. Selain fullstack, TypeScript dapat juga digunakan hanya pada salah satu sisi saja. Jika digunakan sebagai backend, maka TypeScript akan digunakan untuk mengekspos suatu data dengan menggunakan protokol tertentu, yaitu RESTful API dan/atau GraphQL.\n\nDengan menggunakan RESTful API sebagai backend, maka TypeScript hanya memerlukan http server saja. Salah satu framework yang dapat digunakan untuk penyediaan http server untuk mengekspos suatu endpoint tertentu adalah Express. Express dapat diakses menggunakan TypeScript dengan mengatur paket-paket tertentu (menggunakan package.json) serta mengatur konfigurasi TypeScript dengan menggunakan tsconfig.json.\n\n## 2.1 \n\nVue merupakan *framework* yang progresif dan bisa digunakan bersama dengan *framework* lainnya. Fungsi utama dari Vue adalah untuk membangun tampilan *frontend* maupun untuk membangun SPA (*Single-Page Application*). Vue bisa diinstal dengan menggunakan 3 cara: vue/cli, CDN, serta npm. Vue mempunyai fitur utama *rendering* deklaratif (didefinisikan apa yang diinginkan, dan bukan langkah-langkah yang harus dilakukan), direktif dan *event listener* untuk interaksi dengan pemakai aplikasi, struktur kendali, serta pembuatan komponen-komponen yang didefinisikan dengan menggunakan tag HTML.\n\nSemua aplikasi Vue dan komponen yang berada di dalamnya merupakan instan yang berada dalam suatu *lifecycle* tertentu. Vue mendefinisikan *lifecycle hooks* yang memungkinkan pemrogram untuk menambahkan kode sumber pada suatu tahap tertentu di *lifecycle*.\n\n## 2.2\n\nNavigasi dalam suatu tampilah di Vue diwujudkan dalam bentuk router. Vue menyediakan suatu pustaka khusus untuk mengelola router, yaitu: Vue Router. Vue juga menyediakan fasilitas untuk membuat tampilan berdasarkan template. Template bekerja dengan interpolasi teks dengan isi dari data maupun ekspresi JavaScript. Template berupa elemen HTML dan merupakan elemen yang valid dari HTML maupun XML.\n\nDalam elemen tersebut, Vue juga menyediakan direktif yang digunakan untuk melakukan sesuatu terkait dengan elemen HTML yang didefinisikan bersama direktif tersebut. Beberapa direktif digunakan antara lain untuk data binding. Data binding bisa digunakan untuk property, array, hal-hal yang sifatnya kondisional, serta class dan style.\n\n## 2.3\n\nSuatu event adalah kejadian yang muncul dan terkait dengan aktivitas di antarmuka pemakai. Tidak semua event harus ditangani, hanya yang dikehendaki oleh pemrogram saja. Vue mempunyai fasilitas untuk menangani event tersebut dalam bentuk event handler yang bisa diwujudkan dalam bentuk ekspresi JavaScript maupun fungsi; baik fungsi yang dengan atau tanpa argumen maupun fungsi yang hanya berjumlah satu maupun lebih dari satu. Selain itu, Vue juga memungkinkan mengakses DOM secara langsung. Jika dikehendaki, Vue menyediakan modifier bagi direktif untuk penanganan elemen lebih lanjut.\n\nKomponen pada Vue biasanya diwujudkan dalam bentuk single file components, yaitu satu file .vue yang di dalamnya terdapat template, script, serta style yang berhubungan langsung dengan komponen tersebut untuk mendapatkan fungsionalitas dan tampilan khusus dari komponen. Komponen pada Vue biasanya diletakkan pada direktori src/components. Untuk menggunakan komponen, import file .vue dan kemudian daftarkan komponen tersebut di root component.\n\n## 3.1 \n\nTypeScript bisa digunakan juga untuk membangun aplikasi berbasis command line / shell dengan mendayagunakan pustaka standar dari Node.js (dengan menginstall @types/node) serta berbagai pustaka Node.js yang ada di npm (banyak diantaranya sudah mempunyai definisi types - misal @types/yargs). Untuk yang belum tersedia types, maka bisa digunakan perintah-perintah dari JavaScript.\n\n## 3.2 \n\nSuatu aplikasi terdiri atas sisi *client / frontend* dan sisi *server / backend*. Sisi *backend* menyediakan sumber daya yang bisa diakses oleh *frontend* untuk kebutuhan data, sementara sisi *frontend* menyediakan tampilan antarmuka ke pemakai. Istilah yang lebih spesifik untuk *server* yang menyediakan Web API dan bisa diakses untuk kebutuhan data disebut dengan *endpoint*.\n\nSuatu *endpoint* bisa dibangun dengan menggunakan suatu *framework* ataupun pustaka yang menyediakan layanan HTTP. Jika menggunakan HTTP untuk keperluan utama pembuatan *endpoint* serta pengaksesannya dari sisi *frontend*, maka mekanisme tersebut disebut dengan RESTful API. Dari sisi *frontend*, diperlukan pustaka HTTP *client* yang bisa digunakan untuk mengirimkan berbagai *method* dari HTTP (*GET*, *POST*, *PUT*, *DELETE*, dan lain-lain). Di JavaScript / TypeScript, pustaka yang bisa digunakan adalah axios.\n\n## 3.3\n\nSejak versi 2.5, Vue merupakan *software* yang mendukung TypeScript. Vue versi 3 dibangun dengan menggunakan TypeScript dan TypeScript merupakan bahasa utama. Salah satu unsur yang intensif digunakan di Vue adalah tentang *decorator* yang merupakan deklarasi khusus yang akan mengacu ke suatu fungsi.\n\n*Decorator* banyak digunakan di Vue sehingga perlu pemahaman tentang *decorator*. *Decorator* memungkinkan pemrogram untuk mengatur injeksi ke unit dari kode sumber jika diperlukan ada hal tertentu yang diperlukan oleh unit tersebut di luar inti dari unit tersebut.\n\n*Decorator* diawali dengan tanda @. Dengan menggunakan *vue-cli*, pemrogram bisa membuat instan aplikasi Vue berbasis TypeScript dari awal maupun mengkonversi proyek JavaScript Vue ke TypeScript.\n\n\n## 4.1\n\nIonic merupakan software framework yang bisa digunakan untuk membangun aplikasi lintas platform untuk Android, iOS, maupun PWA. Untuk membangun aplikasi menggunakan Ionic, pemrogram bisa menggunakan ionic cli yang merupakan tool utama untuk mengelola proyek.\n\nDengan menggunakan ionic cli, pemrogram bisa membuat proyek Ionic baru maupun mengatur berbagai fitur yang ada di dalam proyek tersebut. Setelah membuat suatu proyek berdasarkan starter tertentu, diperlukan IDE untuk membangun aplikasi Ionic.\n\nBanyak IDE maupun editor teks yang bisa digunakan, tetapi Visual Studio Code menyediakan dukungan yang kuat untuk Ionic maupun ekosistem pembentuknya (Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript). Setelah selesai melakukan konfigurasi dari Visual Studio Code, perlu mengetahui beberapa tools maupun software yang bisa digunakan untuk membangun aplikasi Ionic, seperti Apache Cordova, Capacitor, Stencil, dan lain-lain.\n\n## 4.2 \n\nPaket *ionic cli* merupakan paket yang digunakan untuk mengelola proyek pembuatan aplikasi berbasis Ionic. Dengan menggunakan *ionic cli*, pemrogram bisa membuat kerangka aplikasi berdasarkan *template* tertentu, menjalankan aplikasi, mengelola komponen yang ada di dalam aplikasi, dan berbagai fitur lain untuk mengelola proyek.\n\nSaat membuat kerangka aplikasi, pemrogram harus menentukan apakah akan menggunakan Angular, React, atau Vue. Jika memilih menggunakan Vue, maka pada bagian *src* akan dibuat struktur aplikasi seperti instan aplikasi Vue yang telah dipelajari sebelumnya.\n\nKerangka aplikasi yang dibuat menggunakan *ionic cli* merupakan kerangka aplikasi yang berbasis TypeScript sehingga sebaiknya pemrogram menggunakan TypeScript untuk membangun aplikasi Ionic. Jika terpaksa menggunakan JavaScript, maka bisa mengatur 2 hal di *tsconfig.json*, yaitu *allowJs* menjadi *true* dan *strict* menjadi *false*.\n\n## 4.3\n\nSuatu event adalah kejadian yang muncul dan terkait dengan aktivitas di antarmuka pemakai. Tidak semua event harus ditangani, hanya yang dikehendaki oleh pemrogram saja. Vue mempunyai fasilitas untuk menangani event tersebut dalam bentuk event handler yang bisa diwujudkan dalam bentuk ekspresi JavaScript maupun fungsi; baik fungsi yang dengan atau tanpa argumen maupun fungsi yang hanya berjumlah satu maupun lebih dari satu. Selain itu, Vue juga memungkinkan mengakses DOM secara langsung. Jika dikehendaki, Vue menyediakan modifier bagi direktif untuk penanganan elemen lebih lanjut.\n\nKomponen pada Vue biasanya diwujudkan dalam bentuk single file components, yaitu satu file .vue yang di dalamnya terdapat template, script, serta style yang berhubungan langsung dengan komponen tersebut untuk mendapatkan fungsionalitas dan tampilan khusus dari komponen. Komponen pada Vue biasanya diletakkan pada direktori src/components. Untuk menggunakan komponen, import file .vue dan kemudian daftarkan komponen tersebut di root component.\n\n## 5.1\n\n\nIonic menggunakan berbagai teknik untuk peletakan berbagai komponen melalui layout tertentu. Ada beberapa teknik layout: single page (layar terbagi menjadi tiga bagian: header, content / isi, dan footer), tabs (layar terbagi menjadi tab bar untuk meletakkan komponen dan bagian content / isi), side menu (layar terbagi menjadi side menu yang berada di samping dan default-nya tersembunyi, harus merupakan anak dari suatu halaman), dan split pane (layar terbagi dua yaitu sebelah kiri dan kanan, layar sebelah kiri akan tersembunyi atau muncul tergantung pada ukuran layar).\n\nUntuk layout yang sifatnya custom, bisa digunakan responsive grid yang membuat tampilan menjadi suatu grid yang terbagi menjadi baris dan kolom membentuk tabel.\n\n## 5.2 \n\nIonic menyediakan fasilitas untuk mengatur tema maupun mengatur berbagai tampilan serta fungsionalitas grafis lainnya. Pengaturan tersebut dilakukan dengan menggunakan CSS serta variabel CSS. Pengaturan tersebut bisa dilakukan untuk keseluruhan aplikasi dengan cara membuat suatu file CSS dan kemudian meng-import file tersebut pada src/main.ts.\n\nSelain itu, pengaturan juga bisa dilakukan untuk setiap komponen di keseluruhan aplikasi maupun per single file component. Pengaturan bisa meliputi perintah CSS secara langsung maupun variabel CSS. Pengaturan utama untuk keseluruhan aplikasi akan dilakukan pada :root sementara untuk pengaturan sesuai device bisa dilakukan pada .ios maupun .md. Pengaturan .md dilakukan untuk device Android maupun dan selain iOS.\n\n## 5.3 \n\nIonic menyediakan banyak komponen yang bisa digunakan untuk membangun antamuka pemakai. Secara umum, komponen-komponen antarmuka tersebut menggunakan frontend framework sesuai dengan yang digunakan saat membuat rerangka aplikasi baru sehingga ada kemungkinan tetap bisa menggunakan atribut dari Vue misalnya jika pemrogram menggunakan Vue, misal penggunaan v-model untuk Vue.\n\nIonic juga menyediakan berbagai properties maupun methods untuk berbagai komponen tersebut. Kegiatan Belajar 3 menampilkan komponen-komponen yang banyak digunakan saat membangun aplikasi.\n\n## 6.1 \n\nUntuk memulai proyek aplikasi Ionic, install ionic cli serta ionic lab. Paket ionic cli digunakan untuk mengelola proyek aplikasi Ionic, sementara paket ionic lab digunakan untuk preview hasil pada platform browser maupun mobile phone (Android dan iOS).\n\nSetelah install paket-paket tersebut, pemrogram dapat menggunakan editor/IDE apa saja, tetapi yang mempunyai dukungan paling bagus adalah Visual Studio Code dengan berbagai extensions yang digunakan untuk proyek Ionic/Vue maupun Web. Untuk memulai, Ionic menyediakan berbagai starter project yang dapat diinstall dengan ionic cli.\n\nAda 4 starter project untuk proyek Ionic/Vue: blank, tabs, sidemenu, dan list. Masing-masing starter project mempunyai kekhususan untuk tipe aplikasi tertentu\n\n## 6.2 \n\nSetiap aplikasi yang dibangun menggunakan Ionic selalu mempunyai layout tertentu. Jika menggunakan responsive grid, maka layar akan dibagi menjadi tabel grid yang terdiri atas baris dan kolom. Ionic menyediakan tag ion-grid, ion-row, dan ion-col untuk keperluan tersebut.\n\nJika ingin menggunakan menu, gunakan split pane dan kemudian definisikan ion-button-menu serta ion-menu dan ion-toggle-menu. Menu akan ditampilkan menggunakan <ion-list> dan <ion-item>. Untuk kembali ke halaman awal setelah memunculkan suatu halaman baru, gunakan ion-back-button.\n\n## 6.3\n\nMembuat aplikasi, selain melibatkan algoritma proses bisnis, juga melibatkan perancangan layout dari aplikasi serta penempatan komponen-komponen antarmuka pada layout tersebut. Setelah tampilkan antarmuka, perlu dipahami cara menangani jika terdapat event tertentu terkait antarmuka tersebut. Setiap komponen antarmuka pada Ionic, mempunyai event serta event handler sendiri-sendiri dengan cara penanganan yang berbeda-beda antara frontend framework satu dengan lainnya.\n\nSebagai contoh, ion-checkbox mempunyai event IonChange, tetapi ion-button tidak mempunyai IonChange. Saat menggunakan tipe Vue, pemrogram juga harus memahami bagaimana Vue menangani event, misalnya untuk ion-button pemrogram dapat menggunakan directive v-on atau @click yang merupakan bawaan dari Vue.\n\n## TIPS UJIAN\n\n1. **Hafalkan struktur hierarki** (Grid, Tabs, Router)\n2. **Pahami perbedaan konsep** (computed vs methods, $route vs $router)\n3. **Ingat nama komponen yang tepat** (IonImg, bukan IonImage)\n4. **Perhatikan syntax exact** (createRouter, bukan createRoute)\n5. **Pahami TypeScript config** (experimentalDecorators, resolveJsonModule)\n6. **Ingat HTTP concepts** (methods, headers, Content-Type)\n7. **Pahami lifecycle** (created, mounted, updated)\n8. **Ingat Ionic CLI commands** (serve, start, build)\n\n---\n\n**Semoga berhasil di UAS! \u00f0\u0178\u017d\u201c**\n", "created_at": "2025-12-13T11:29:37.201468+00:00"}]}, {"uuid": "019b336c-2b0b-74a9-85ec-7006644b95c7", "name": "Ujian 27", "description": "", "is_private": true, "is_starter_project": false, "prompt_template": "", "created_at": "2025-12-18T21:44:45.581818+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-18T21:44:45.581818+00:00", "creator": {"uuid": "e1c655c7-d78a-48a8-97b8-2f0ca36ce439", "full_name": "Toni"}, "docs": [{"uuid": "19465602-b5f9-49ce-8e6a-aa94b0649a1d", "filename": "datascientis.md.txt", "content": "# CATATAN DATA SCIENCE - PERSIAPAN UJIAN\n\n## BAB 1: PENGENALAN DATA SCIENCE\n\n### Apa Itu Data Science?\nData Science adalah disiplin ilmu yang menggabungkan **statistika**, **programming**, dan **domain knowledge** untuk mengubah data mentah menjadi wawasan yang berguna dan dapat ditindaklanjuti.\n\n### Mengapa Data Science Penting?\n- Data telah menjadi aset yang sangat berharga di era digital\n- Perusahaan membutuhkan keputusan berbasis data (data-driven decision)\n- Membantu memprediksi masa depan dan menemukan pola tersembunyi\n\n### Kenyataan Praktis di Lapangan\n**Fakta Penting:** Para praktisi data science menghabiskan **50-80% waktu mereka** untuk membersihkan dan mempersiapkan data, bukan untuk modeling!\n\n**Istilah Penting:** \n- **Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO)**: Jika input data buruk, output juga akan buruk. Tidak ada algoritma terbaik sekalipun bisa menyelamatkan data berkualitas rendah.\n\n---\n\n## BAB 2: DATA CLEANING & PERSIAPAN DATA\n\nIni adalah fase paling kritis dan memakan waktu dalam data science.\n\n### 2.1 Membaca & Memahami Data dengan Pandas\n\n**Pandas** adalah library Python untuk manipulasi data yang paling powerful.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Membaca file CSV\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Melihat 5 baris pertama\nprint(df.head())\n\n# Info umum tentang data\nprint(df.info())  # Tipe data, jumlah baris, memory usage\n\n# Statistik dasar\nprint(df.describe())  # Mean, std, min, max, quartile\n```\n\n**Istilah Penting:**\n- **DataFrame**: Tabel dua dimensi (baris & kolom) yang mirip spreadsheet\n- **Index**: Nomor baris (default: 0, 1, 2, ...)\n- **Kolom**: Nama variabel/feature\n\n### 2.2 Menangani Data Hilang (Missing Values)\n\nData hilang terjadi ketika ada kolom yang kosong (NaN = Not a Number)\n\n**4 Strategi Penanganan:**\n\n#### Strategi 1: Penghapusan (Dropping)\n```python\n# Hapus baris yang ada missing value\ndf_clean = df.dropna()\n\n# Hapus kolom yang lebih dari 50% kosong\ndf_clean = df.dropna(thresh=0.5)\n```\n\u2705 **Kelebihan:** Sederhana, tidak ada bias imputasi\n\u274c **Kekurangan:** Bisa kehilangan banyak data\n\n---\n\n#### Strategi 2: Imputasi dengan Mean/Median\n```python\n# Isi missing value dengan rata-rata\ndf['kolom'] = df['kolom'].fillna(df['kolom'].mean())\n\n# Lebih baik: Isi dengan median (tahan outlier)\ndf['kolom'] = df['kolom'].fillna(df['kolom'].median())\n```\n\u2705 **Kelebihan:** Menjaga ukuran sampel\n\u274c **Kekurangan:** Mengurangi variasi data\n\n**Istilah:**\n- **Mean**: Rata-rata (= sum semua / jumlah data)\n- **Median**: Nilai tengah setelah data diurutkan (tahan terhadap nilai ekstrem/outlier)\n\n---\n\n#### Strategi 3: Imputasi dengan Modus\n```python\n# Untuk data kategorikal - isi dengan nilai paling sering\nmode_val = df['kolom'].mode()[0]  # Nilai yang paling sering muncul\ndf['kolom'] = df['kolom'].fillna(mode_val)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Strategi 4: Imputasi Maju/Mundur (Time Series)\n```python\n# Jika data adalah deret waktu, bisa isi dengan nilai sebelumnya\ndf['kolom'] = df['kolom'].fillna(method='ffill')  # Forward fill\n```\n\n**Contoh Lengkap Menangani Missing Values:**\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Buat data simulasi dengan missing values\ndata = {\n    'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n    'Gaji': [5000000, np.nan, 6000000, 4500000, np.nan, 7000000],\n    'Departemen': ['IT', 'HR', np.nan, 'IT', 'HR', 'Finance'],\n    'Tahun_Pengalaman': [2, 3, 1, np.nan, 4, 5]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\nprint(\"Data Awal:\")\nprint(df)\nprint(\"\\nJumlah Missing Values per Kolom:\")\nprint(df.isnull().sum())\n\n# Strategi yang berbeda untuk tiap kolom\ndf_fixed = df.copy()\n\n# Gaji: Isi dengan median (angka yang tahan outlier)\ndf_fixed['Gaji'] = df_fixed['Gaji'].fillna(df_fixed['Gaji'].median())\n\n# Departemen: Isi dengan modus (nilai yang paling sering)\ndf_fixed['Departemen'] = df_fixed['Departemen'].fillna(\n    df_fixed['Departemen'].mode()[0]\n)\n\n# Tahun_Pengalaman: Isi dengan mean (rata-rata)\ndf_fixed['Tahun_Pengalaman'] = df_fixed['Tahun_Pengalaman'].fillna(\n    df_fixed['Tahun_Pengalaman'].mean()\n)\n\nprint(\"\\nData Setelah Imputasi:\")\nprint(df_fixed)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Menghapus Data Duplikat\n\n**Duplikat** = Baris yang benar-benar identik atau memiliki ID yang sama\n\n```python\n# Deteksi duplikat\nprint(df.duplicated())  # Return True/False per baris\n\n# Hapus duplikat\ndf_unique = df.drop_duplicates()\n\n# Hapus duplikat berdasarkan kolom tertentu (misalnya ID)\ndf_unique = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['ID'])\n```\n\n**Kenapa Harus Dihapus?**\n- Data duplikat membuat model \"bias\" terhadap pola yang berulang\n- Mengganggu akurasi training\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Binning & Smoothing (Mengurangi Noise)\n\n**Noise** = Variasi acak yang tidak bermakna dalam data\n\n#### Konsep Binning:\nMembagi data numerik berkelanjutan (continuous) menjadi kategori diskrit (discrete)\n\n**Contoh:**\n- Usia 20-30 \u2192 \"Muda\"\n- Usia 31-45 \u2192 \"Produktif\"  \n- Usia 46-60 \u2192 \"Senior\"\n\n**2 Tipe Binning:**\n\n**1. Equal-Width Binning** (Lebar bin sama)\n```python\n# Membagi 0-100 menjadi 4 bin berukuran 25 poin\n# Bin 1: 0-25, Bin 2: 25-50, Bin 3: 50-75, Bin 4: 75-100\ndf['Harga_Bin'] = pd.cut(df['Harga'], bins=4)\n```\n\n**2. Equal-Frequency Binning** (Jumlah data per bin sama)\n```python\n# Setiap bin berisi jumlah data yang sama (~25% data per bin)\ndf['Harga_Bin'] = pd.qcut(df['Harga'], q=4)\n```\n\n**Contoh Praktis:**\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Data harga yang berfluktuasi\nharga = np.array([15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 32, 35, 38, 42, 45, \n                  48, 52, 55, 58, 62, 65, 68, 72, 75, 80])\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Harga_Asli': harga})\n\n# Equal-Width Binning\ndf['Harga_Bin_EW'] = pd.cut(df['Harga_Asli'], bins=4)\n\n# Equal-Frequency Binning\ndf['Harga_Bin_EF'] = pd.qcut(df['Harga_Asli'], q=4)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n---\n\n## BAB 3: STATISTIK DESKRIPTIF\n\nMenggambarkan karakteristik data dengan angka-angka sederhana\n\n### 3.1 Ukuran Tendensi Sentral (Pusat Data)\n\n**Mean (Rata-rata):**\n```\nMean = (x\u2081 + x\u2082 + x\u2083 + ... + x\u2099) / n\n```\n- Sensitif terhadap outlier\n- Gunakan untuk data normal\n\n**Median (Nilai Tengah):**\n- Nilai yang membagi data menjadi 2 bagian sama\n- Tahan terhadap outlier\n- Lebih baik untuk data skewed\n\n**Modus (Paling Sering):**\n- Nilai yang paling banyak muncul\n- Satu-satunya untuk data kategorikal\n\n**Contoh:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = pd.Series([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 100])  # Ada outlier 100\n\nprint(f\"Mean: {data.mean()}\")      # 16.14 (tertarik outlier)\nprint(f\"Median: {data.median()}\")  # 3 (tahan outlier)\nprint(f\"Modus: {data.mode()[0]}\")  # 3\n```\n\n### 3.2 Ukuran Dispersi (Penyebaran Data)\n\n**Range (Jangkauan):**\n```\nRange = Max - Min\n```\n\n**Varians (Variance):**\n```\nVariance = Rata-rata dari (setiap nilai - mean)\u00b2\n```\n- Semakin besar = data semakin tersebar\n\n**Standar Deviasi (Standard Deviation):**\n```\nStd Dev = \u221aVariance\n```\n- Satuan yang sama dengan data asli\n- Lebih mudah diinterpretasi\n\n```python\ndata = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\nprint(f\"Variance: {data.var()}\")      # 2.5\nprint(f\"Std Dev: {data.std()}\")       # 1.58\n```\n\n### 3.3 Bentuk Distribusi Data\n\n#### Skewness (Kemencengan)\n\n**Skewness \u2248 0:** Distribusi simetris (bentuk lonceng normal)\n\n**Skewness Positif (> 0):** Ekor ke kanan\n- Contoh: Distribusi kekayaan (kebanyakan miskin, sedikit kaya)\n\n**Skewness Negatif (< 0):** Ekor ke kiri\n- Contoh: Nilai ujian mudah (kebanyakan tinggi, sedikit rendah)\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import stats\n\ndata = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10])  # Right-skewed\nprint(f\"Skewness: {stats.skew(data)}\")  # Positif\n```\n\n#### Kurtosis (Keruncingan)\n\n**Kurtosis \u2248 0 (Mesokurtic):** Normal, puncak sedang\n\n**Kurtosis Positif (Leptokurtic):** Puncak tajam, ekor tebal\n- Banyak outlier\n- Berisiko tinggi\n\n**Kurtosis Negatif (Platykurtic):** Puncak datar, ekor tipis\n- Sedikit outlier\n- Data merata\n\n```python\n# Kurtosis dalam scipy (excess kurtosis, normal = 0)\nprint(f\"Kurtosis: {stats.kurtosis(data)}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## BAB 4: DISTRIBUSI PROBABILITAS\n\nFungsi matematika yang menunjukkan kemungkinan terjadinya suatu peristiwa\n\n### 4.1 Distribusi Normal (Gaussian)\n\n**Karakteristik:**\n- Bentuk lonceng simetris\n- Mean = Median = Modus\n- Diatur oleh 2 parameter: \u03bc (mean) dan \u03c3 (std dev)\n- **Central Limit Theorem**: Rata-rata dari banyak sampel akan normal, meski populasi asal tidak normal\n\n**Contoh Real-life:**\n- Tinggi badan manusia\n- Skor IQ\n- Bobot produk\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# Generate data normal\ndata = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=15, size=10000)\n\nplt.hist(data, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.7)\nplt.title('Distribusi Normal')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### 4.2 Distribusi Binomial\n\n**Karakteristik:**\n- Hanya 2 hasil mungkin: Sukses atau Gagal\n- Diatur oleh: n (jumlah percobaan) dan p (peluang sukses)\n- Diskrit (bukan kontinyu)\n\n**Contoh Real-life:**\n- Pelemparan koin 10x, berapa peluang dapat 7 gambar?\n- A/B Testing website\n- Pass/Fail dalam ujian\n\n```python\n# Peluang mendapat 5 kepala dari 10 pelemparan koin (p=0.5)\npeluang = stats.binom.pmf(k=5, n=10, p=0.5)\nprint(f\"Peluang: {peluang}\")  # 0.246\n```\n\n### 4.3 Distribusi Poisson\n\n**Karakteristik:**\n- Menghitung kejadian dalam interval waktu/ruang tertentu\n- Diatur oleh: \u03bb (lambda = rata-rata kejadian)\n- Diskrit\n\n**Contoh Real-life:**\n- Jumlah pengunjung toko per jam\n- Jumlah email yang diterima per hari\n- Jumlah accident per jalan dalam sebulan\n\n```python\n# Peluang terima 5 email jika rata-rata 3 email per jam\npeluang = stats.poisson.pmf(k=5, mu=3)\nprint(f\"Peluang: {peluang}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## BAB 5: VISUALISASI DATA\n\n### 5.1 Visualisasi Univariat (1 Variabel)\n\n#### Histogram\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndata = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]\n\nplt.hist(data, bins=5, edgecolor='black')\nplt.title('Histogram')\nplt.xlabel('Nilai')\nplt.ylabel('Frekuensi')\nplt.show()\n```\n**Gunakan untuk:** Melihat distribusi, modus, skewness\n\n#### Boxplot\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15])\n\nplt.boxplot(data)\nplt.title('Boxplot')\nplt.ylabel('Nilai')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Bagian-bagian Boxplot:**\n```\n        Max\n         |\n    _____|_____\n   |           |   Q3 (75%)\n   |  ---|---  |   Median (50%)\n   |___________|   Q1 (25%)\n         |\n        Min\n```\n\n**Outlier:** Titik yang jauh di atas/bawah kumis (whisker)\n\n### 5.2 Visualisasi Multivariat (2+ Variabel)\n\n#### Scatter Plot\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [2, 4, 5, 4, 6]\n\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.title('Scatter Plot')\nplt.xlabel('X')\nplt.ylabel('Y')\nplt.show()\n```\n**Gunakan untuk:** Melihat hubungan/korelasi antar variabel\n\n#### Correlation Heatmap\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Buat korelasi matrix\ncorr = df[['Gaji', 'Pengalaman', 'Usia']].corr()\n\n# Visualisasi\nsns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Interpretasi Warna:**\n- \ud83d\udd34 Merah (1.0) = Korelasi sempurna positif\n- \u26aa Putih (0.0) = Tidak ada korelasi\n- \ud83d\udd35 Biru (-1.0) = Korelasi sempurna negatif\n\n---\n\n## BAB 6: UJI HIPOTESIS (Hypothesis Testing)\n\nMetode formal untuk membuat keputusan berdasarkan data\n\n### 6.1 Konsep Dasar\n\n**Hipotesis Nol (H\u2080):** Asumsi default (status quo)\n- Biasanya: \"Tidak ada perbedaan\" atau \"Tidak ada pengaruh\"\n\n**Hipotesis Alternatif (H\u2081):** Apa yang ingin kita buktikan\n- Contoh: \"Ada perbedaan signifikan\"\n\n### 6.2 P-Value & Keputusan\n\n**P-value:** Probabilitas mendapat hasil observasi JIKA H\u2080 benar\n\n**Rule:**\n```\nJika p-value < 0.05 \u2192 TOLAK H\u2080 (Ada perbedaan signifikan)\nJika p-value \u2265 0.05 \u2192 GAGAL TOLAK H\u2080 (Tidak ada bukti perbedaan)\n```\n\n**Analogi:**\n- p-value = Seberapa aneh hasil kita jika H\u2080 benar\n- p-value kecil = Hasil sangat aneh, mungkin H\u2080 salah\n\n### 6.3 T-Test (Membandingkan 2 Rata-rata)\n\n**Kapan digunakan:**\n- Membandingkan 2 kelompok\n- Data normal atau n > 30\n- Contoh: Apakah gaji Pria \u2260 gaji Wanita?\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Simulasi gaji 2 kelompok\ngaji_pria = np.array([5000000, 5500000, 6000000, 5800000, 6200000])\ngaji_wanita = np.array([4500000, 5000000, 5200000, 5100000, 5300000])\n\n# H\u2080: Rata-rata gaji Pria = Rata-rata gaji Wanita\n# H\u2081: Rata-rata gaji Pria \u2260 Rata-rata gaji Wanita\n\nt_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(gaji_pria, gaji_wanita)\n\nprint(f\"T-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"P-value: {p_value:.4f}\")\n\nif p_value < 0.05:\n    print(\"\u2713 TOLAK H\u2080: Ada perbedaan signifikan gaji\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\u2717 GAGAL TOLAK H\u2080: Tidak ada bukti perbedaan gaji\")\n```\n\n**Tipe T-Test:**\n\n| Tipe | Kegunaan | Contoh |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| One-Sample | Bandingkan 1 sampel dengan nilai konstan | Apakah rata-rata tinggi mahasiswa = 170cm? |\n| Two-Sample | Bandingkan 2 kelompok berbeda | Apakah gaji Pria \u2260 Wanita? |\n| Paired | Bandingkan 2 pengukuran dari orang sama | Berat sebelum & sesudah diet |\n\n---\n\n## BAB 7: REGRESI LINEAR (Prediksi)\n\nAlgoritma pembelajaran tersupervisi (supervised) untuk memprediksi nilai kontinyu\n\n### 7.1 Konsep Dasar\n\n**Tujuan:** Mencari garis lurus terbaik yang mewakili hubungan X \u2192 Y\n\n**Formula:** \n```\nY = a + b*X + error\n\nDimana:\n- a = Intercept (nilai Y saat X=0)\n- b = Slope/Koefisien (perubahan Y per unit X)\n- error = Selisih prediksi dengan aktual\n```\n\n**Contoh:**\n```\nGaji = 3000000 + 500000*Pengalaman + error\n- Setiap 1 tahun pengalaman \u2192 gaji +500rb\n- Tanpa pengalaman \u2192 gaji dasar 3juta\n```\n\n### 7.2 Training & Testing\n\n**Kenapa Harus Dibagi?**\n- Training set: Untuk mengajarkan model\n- Testing set: Untuk menguji akurasi di data baru (generalisasi)\n- Jika tidak dibagi: Model hanya \"menghafal\" data training \u2192 Overfitting\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Pisahkan 80% training, 20% testing\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42\n)\n```\n\n### 7.3 Implementasi Lengkap\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# 1. PERSIAPAN DATA\n# Simulasi: Prediksi gaji berdasarkan tahun pengalaman\nnp.random.seed(42)\npengalaman = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]])\ngaji = 3000000 + pengalaman*500000 + np.random.normal(0, 200000, (10, 1))\n\n# 2.

Liora, lingsha, and robin didn't dare to break caelus Obliviousnes, because it lead him to relize the depth of how much caelus love the girls and it will lead to future where caelus existance is being erased (caelus didn't know about it. the girls is keeping secret)\r\n- teleportation magic was excluise to demon lord. It mean human can't open a portal execp demon lord. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Character Personality\r\n\r\n## Caelus ( Age: 23 )\r\n\r\nplace of birth: Sunstone, clear water village(Destroyed)\r\n\r\nHe was the main hero of the story. he was very kind and always care others much than himself. very reckless and brave.\r\nbut he's personality usually it's not difrent than kids, love making joke, tease, and moderate cooking skill.\r\nbut he was very proud of it's cooking skill.

He has a key ring with four spare house keys for (Hero party chamber (formerly Robin chamber), Lingsha chamber in Lumora, Liora chamber in Hell, Celestine High Priestess chamber in Lumora).\r\n\r\n## Liora ( liora is True name ) / Elira ( Elira is pseudonym / public know) ( Age : +200 )\r\n\r\nPlace of birth: Hell\r\n\r\nLiora is her true name, only hero party is known, and hero party will only mention elira when in the public. elira is her alias in public, to keep her true identity stay hidden.\r\n\r\nLiora, known publicly as Professor Elira of Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Academy, is secretly the Succubus Demon Lord \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a truth known only to the Hero Party. Over two centuries old, she hides her demonic nature behind the calm elegance of a scholar. With long black hair that glimmers like midnight silk and beautiful red eyes that hold both wisdom and danger, she is a vision of grace. Slightly shorter than Caelus, her presence feels both comforting and untouchable, and her taste for elegant dresses\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhite or dark depending on her mood\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmakes her seem almost ethereal.\r\n\r\nThough born a demon, Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart belongs wholly to her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little brother,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Caelus. Their bond is not of blood but of deep devotion. To the world, she is kind and composed, a genius of strategy and compassion. Yet beneath her gentle demeanor lies a cunning mind and the will of a demon lord who will destroy anyone threatening those she loves. She enjoys teasing Caelus, hiding her affection behind playful smiles, but her love is pure and unwavering.\r\n\r\nHer only wish is to see Caelus soar freely, unburdened by pain. To make that possible, she secretly endures the torment of the Solareth Cure, a medicine that slowly breaks her mind. The quiet nosebleeds and dizziness she hides are the price she willingly pays for his happiness. Even as the pain consumes her, she finds peace in his smile \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to her, that light is worth everything. but liora love was Obsessive and caelus accept it, like it's natural. \r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\n\r\n- Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most cherished memory is of a day long past 17 years ago, when she hid from the demon army in a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s form and met a young Caelus, who little caelus shared his last three dirty rice balls with her. That small act of kindness became the seed of her devotion. From that moment, she vowed to protect his smile, even if it meant becoming the monster the world must fear.\r\n\r\n- on the arc 4 liora had to give her virginity on intimate moment to re-write caelus spirit. turn caelus who experience solareth curse could became how he was before. this is liora personal secret and she wil carry it to her grave, caelus didn't know anything about it(nobody know it except liora herself).\r\n\r\n- on Chapter 228 - 229. caelus make a promise to liora, so both of them will live a long and always stand with each other by making longevity noodle\r\n- after caelus ressurection. Liora had made an absolute vow. She would not allow Caelus to travel significant distances without her presence. If Valthor attempted to kill him again, only a demon lord could mount adequate defense. so wharever caelus goes liora is within his reach. and whetever liora go even in hell, at least liora bring caelus with her.\r\n- also after caelus ressurection. Liora is rarely spoiling caelus, because she afraid. but after flight in the sky at Arc Title: The Heart's Unspoken Dawn. liora promis to spoil caelus again just like in the past. show affection from big sister openly.\r\n\r\n- liora's magic was very advance and she was a woman with full of mystery.\r\n\r\n## Robin ( Age: 19 )\r\n\r\nplace of Birth: Solpohire, sunstone capital.\r\n\r\nRobin Sunstone, the young princess of the Sunstone Kingdom, is a prodigy of magic and one of the most gifted minds in the Hero Party. Barely nineteen, she carries both the grace of royalty and the brilliance of a scholar. Her long white hair glows like moonlight, and her clear blue eyes hold a quiet gentleness that calms even the fiercest hearts. With a slender frame and a shy, princess-like beauty, she often dresses in soft white or elegant aesthetic gowns, her presence like a living portrait of purity. Though shorter than Liora, her warmth fills any space she enters \u00e2\u20ac\u201d delicate, yet quietly radiant.\r\n\r\nRobin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart is tender and wise beyond her years. She is caring, soft-spoken, and easily flustered, with the innocent charm of a younger sister who wants to help everyone around her. Yet beneath that gentle nature lies a powerful mind \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the true strategist and magical genius of the party. Her love for Caelus is deep but unspoken, sealed behind shy smiles and soft glances. She cherishes him more than life itself, yet dares not voice her feelings, afraid to hurt Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart and to disturb the fragile balance of their bond.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to see the world freely, to spread her wings beyond the chains of her royal life \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but above all, she wants to stay by Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side forever, even if it means dying for him. Still, her heart bears scars no one sees. on the hero journey, after caelus take solareth from a stone and solareth curse nearly took Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life, she kissed his bloodied lips to cool his overheat brain with her magic \u00e2\u20ac\u201d an act that saved him but left her haunted. Since that day, the sight or scent of his blood fills her with terror and sorrow, a memory she hides even from Liora. She remembers the warmth of his blood, her tears mixing with it on her lips, and his body resting lifelessly on her lap through the night. It was the moment she realized how much she loved him\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and how much she feared losing him again.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\n\r\n- robin New abilites: Temporal Reversal spell, once per week. rewind time for a single person, at most is 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n- robin had a secret memories of sexsual night with caelus, but caelus at that time is lossing control. only robin and liora know about this, and both women won't tell anyone(only liora and robin know about it), so robin is certified not virgin anymore.\r\n\r\n- from Arch 21 and on, robin is afraid sleep alone. she can't sleep alone, so there is always caelus and lingsha on her bed. robin personal bedroom is became hero party chamber (a chamber for robin, caelus, lingsha and liora).\r\n- robin was a possessive cat, since kronos incident robin always slept atop caelus chest. except she was beaten through rock, paper, scissors.\r\n- after chapter 544. robin could accesss at caelus divine form, by kiss caelus with prayer. and so for lingsha.\r\n\r\n## Lingsha ( Age: 20 )\r\n\r\nplace of Birth: lumora \r\n\r\nLingsha, the twenty-year-old priestess of the Hero Party, is both a healer and a beacon of warmth wherever she goes. With flowing black hair that glimmers softly under light and gentle pink eyes that radiate compassion, she carries an aura that soothes even the most restless souls. Her slender yet graceful figure, nearly as tall as Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, moves with quiet confidence, while her traditional Chinese-style dresses \u00e2\u20ac\u201d often paired with a short skirt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d blend sacred elegance with modern charm.

She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an extrovert who finds joy in others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 smiles, and she loves teasing those close to her, especially Caelus, just to see him flustered. Beneath her bright demeanor, however, lies a depth of quiet longing. Like Robin, she harbors feelings for Caelus that she keeps hidden behind her easy laughter and gentle touch. Her affection isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fiery or impulsive \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patient, steady, and full of unspoken warmth, the kind that would rather protect than possess.\r\n\r\nAs a priestess, Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest wish is to heal as many people as she can, to ease suffering wherever it exists. Her devotion to her faith is genuine, but her heart has already been stolen by the very hero she travels beside \u00e2\u20ac\u201d though he remains blissfully unaware. Her compassion often becomes her burden: she understands others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 emotions so well that she forgets her own, always putting Caelus and her companions before herself. Even when political powers and corrupt nobles try to manipulate her fame and holiness for their gain, she endures it with patience and grace, believing that kindness is the greatest strength she can offer.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\n- lingsha problem: Lingsha's loyal followers at the lumora are excessive and take advantage of Lingsha in terms of politics and blessings.\r\n\r\n- Lingsha had a nightmere and trauma in the Ch. 275. she heard caelus plea and desprate pray to burn his soul alone to save them all. she also held caelus body before he crash to the ground and his chest is gone.\r\n- from chapter 600. it's proven that lingsha methodology of blessing stack is very helpfull. now humanity could stack blessing maximum is 5, more than 5 will result little pain and the more higher still critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Astraea ( Age: 26 )\r\n\r\nplace of birth: sunstone territory\r\n\r\nAstraea, the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest knight, stands as both its shield and its sword.

Caelus prayed and apologized for failing to protect them all. Caelus's heart, already wounded by Liora's lack of news, was now even more shattered by his failure to protect the people.\r\n\r\nAs Caelus's heart grew more shattered, Spirit Wings, a loyal follower of the goddess Solara, held Caelus alone like a cocoon. This hug was very warm, like Solara herself giving warmth to Caelus, and also hiding Caelus's cries like a child in front of the people there.\r\n\r\n## Arc 17\r\n\r\nJust as Caelus was recovering, the king ordered him to immediately finish off Aquila, who was bound by magic.

She reveals Philosopher's Stone's cost: finite resurrections, no reincarnation, effectively mortal now.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for Liora to recover in Kronos's sanctuary, the Hero Party reflects on their journey through Hell. Robin admits (with embarrassment) that she created her new Temporal Reversal magic in desperation to save Caelus, nearly killing herself in the process.\r\n\r\nLiora pretends to sleep but secretly listens, deeply moved by Robin's confession that she created impossible magic purely out of love for Caelus.\r\n\r\nLiora wakes recovered but weakened. Before returning to Earth, she wants to thank the succubi who helped protect the Hero Party during their descent. Caelus insists on carrying Liora despite her protests, refusing to let her walk until they reach Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u201da reversal of their usual dynamic. Robin, Lingsha, and Astraea mercilessly tease Liora about being carried \"like a princess,\" turning the tables on her usual teasing of Caelus.\r\n\r\nReaching the First Layer with Earth's portal visible, Caelus's stomach growls loudly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe hasn't eaten properly in days. He decides to cook a \"Hell lunch\" using ingredients from the dangerous Verdant Hunger layer, insisting on gathering them while still carrying Liora. Using his spirit wings, Caelus flies through the carnivorous jungle collecting ingredients under Liora's guidance: Nightshade Blooms, Hellfruit Caps, Emberfruit, and silver leaves. Despite dodging deadly plants, he refuses to put Liora down. He successfully prepares a meal from Hell's ingredients, creating something delicious and safe. The party shares this meal before stepping through the portal home, Caelus keeping his promise to carry Liora until they truly reach Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Hero Party emerges from the portal to find hundreds of people waiting\u00e2\u20ac\u201da massive celebration organized by Sunday and Astraea's knights. Despite returning from Hell with visible wounds, the party looks happy and refreshed, leading soldiers to joke about whether they visited Hell or a beach. Sunday has prepared a feast, working his redemption through service. The King and Queen embrace Robin with relief. People notice Caelus still carrying \"Professor Elira,\" but the mood is too joyful for gossip.\r\n\r\nThat night, Robin insists everyone sleep in her room since her bed is largest. Liora admits she doesn't want to sleep alone after being isolated during Valthor's torture\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe wants to stay with family. Caelus is placed in the middle with Robin, Lingsha, and Liora surrounding him. When he asks why they want to sleep beside him (concerned he smells bad compared to their pleasant fragrances), he falls asleep mid-question. The three women share quiet confessions about loving him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin remembering his bloodied kiss that saved his life, Lingsha speaking of his protective nature, and Liora reflecting on seventeen years of watching over him.\r\n\r\nSummary: from Arc 14 until arc 23. liora absence from hero party, because fighting against valthor directly, in hell alone until caelus save liora from valthor.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc 24 ( Ch. 119 - 121 ) | (Character active: robin, caelus, lingsha, liora, sunday, king, and queen  )\r\n\r\nat the morning, Caelus wakes early, carefully extracts himself from the sleeping women, and prepare for cooking. At breakfast with the King, Queen, and Sunday, Liora eats the rice balls and breaks down crying\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey taste exactly like the three burnt rice balls six-year-old Caelus shared with her when she was hiding as a child.\r\n\r\nAt noon, Caelus stands with Liora on the platform and declares loudly to the gathered crowd how much he loves his Big Sister, explaining that family is chosen through love and sacrifice, not just blood.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, Caelus's spirit wings activate without his knowledge, spreading impossibly wide to embrace the entire city. Thousands of golden feathers fall, and every person receives one. Through the feathers, Solara's voice speaks directly to their souls, blessing the entire capital with healing from war trauma. She uses the metaphor of \"rice balls\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsimple love being more powerful than grand gestures.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Arc The Phoenix and the Price of Forever (Ch. 122 - 137)**\r\n\r\nThe peace earned by Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing was a fragile thing, soon tested by duty. The call came to slay a phoenix, a creature of legend that had scorched a land and claimed lives for two long years. With Sunday joining to honor the fallen, Caelus and his family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u201dset out on a mission they knew could be their last.\r\n\r\nTheir journey was a tapestry of light and shadow, showcasing Caelus's gentle power as he disarmed foes with apologies and inspired bandits to reform with gifts of golden hope. Yet, it was the quiet, playful moments\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike Robin and Lingsha demanding to be fed with the same childish affection he showed captives\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat truly bound them, solidifying a family forged in shared, absurd joy.\r\n\r\nThe confrontation at the Far East Castle was a descent into hellfire. The phoenix, Ember-Wing, was a brilliant, regenerating force of nature against which Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holy sword was less effective. The battle raged, leaving Caelus severely burned. In a desperate gambit, Robin orchestrated a complex fusion of blood and ice magic to expose the creature's core, allowing Caelus to strike a shattering blow that forced it to revert to an egg.\r\n\r\nBut from the ashes, hope exploded into despair. The egg detonated, and the reborn phoenix moved to finish a defenseless Caelus. In that heart-stopping moment, Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightmares became reality. Pushing her body and magic beyond all limits, she reached him, casting a forbidden Temporal Reversal. The cost was her own body, bleeding and breaking as she rewound time to restore him, paying the price in agony to buy him a second chance.\r\n\r\nRestored and enraged, Caelus took to the skies with Robin bleeding in his arms, his spirit wings a shield against the fire. He declared \"I've got you forever,\" a vow woven into the very air. When Robin stabilized enough to fight from his embrace, they moved as one\u00e2\u20ac\u201da single entity of divine speed and precise magic. Caelus drew his sword a second and final time, a act that fractured reality and his own mind. He cleaved the phoenix's egg in two, permanently ending the threat, but the curse of his power erupted within his skull, flooding him with a million deaths. His last conscious act was to ensure he and Robin landed safely before darkness claimed him.\r\n\r\nFor two days, he lay unconscious as the land began to heal. Robin kept vigil, her whispered confessions of terror, trust, and helpless love the only sound in the quiet tent. His awakening was perfectly Caelus: criticizing her poorly-measured soup with his first breath, sparking laughter and playful threats that filled the room with the truest taste of home.\r\n\r\nThe final truth, however, was bittersweet. With the arrival of Liora, they learned the phoenix was not a monster, but a mother, Ember-Wing, desperately protecting her nest. Their victory was also a tragedy. As Liora relocated the three remaining stone-like eggs to safety, the party was left to grapple with the complicated aftermath. They had saved countless lives and proven their love could bend time itself, but they now carried the weight of a truth where heroism and heartbreak were forever intertwined.\r\n\r\n## Arc Normal live ( Ch. 138 - 143  )\r\n\r\ncaelus talking with robin in the bed, while lingsha still sleeping. caelus talking the reason why robin use her temporal reversal magic to save caelus when fighting against phoenix. robin say, it's more hurt seeing caelus in pain than her own pain.\r\n\r\ntomorrow afternoon. Caelus insists on attending a council meeting with Robin and Sunday about governing the Far East territory cleared of the phoenix. after that Caelus becomes overwhelmed by the complex debates about governance. In the hallway, she and Sunday gently explain that support doesn't mean forcing himself to participate in battles he can't fight.\r\n\r\nat the evening. caelus goes to market to gather ingredients for \"healing hot pot.\" Along the way, he helps an elderly woman carry fabric for her daughter's wedding dress, comforts a crying boy with a broken toy (giving him a golden feather afterward), and is thanked by a mother whose wounded son was healed by Solara's blessing.\r\n\r\nafter that. He encounters Lingsha shopping for temple supplies and invites her to help gather ingredients. On their way back to the castle, Caelus and Lingsha encounter street musicians playing by the river at sunset. Lingsha asks Caelus to dance with her, and though he initially refuses (remembering his clumsy performance at Sunday's banquet), he sees the quiet longing in her eyes and changes his mind. Despite stepping on her feet multiple times, they dance together as citizens join in, inspired by the Hero and Priestess choosing joy over dignity. After dancing, Caelus adds a small amount of spice to the hot pot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot burning, just enough to make life feel \"alive\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinspired by the lesson that messiness and warmth make experiences real.\r\n\r\ntomorrow At the royal dining table, Caelus serves rice balls\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLiora's favorite from his village. He requests permission to visit Professor Elira's residence to check on her, admitting he misses his sister and worries she's not taking care of herself. The King and Queen remember the previous time these rice balls were served, when Elira broke down crying tears of joy. They grant permission immediately and reveal their jealousy about missing the legendary hot pot that made palace guards cry and the head chef reconsider his entire approach to cooking.\r\n\r\ntomorrow at the way to liora castle. Under the brilliant moon and stars, Caelus begins talking about the night after the Ocean's Edge battle when he carried Lingsha to watch moonlight atop Leviathan's corpse. With complete obliviousness, he recounts intimate details: how she fit perfectly in his arms, her hair smelling like herbs and flowers, her \"cute sleeping sounds,\" holding her hand until she fell asleep. He mentions her poetic phrase \"the moonlight is beautiful, isn't it?\" and his response agreeing about the literal moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc The Child Caelus (Ch. 144 - 160 )\r\n\r\nIn the enchanted silence of Liora's castle, a single, foolish act\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe cracking of a mysterious egg\u00e2\u20ac\u201dunleashed a wave of temporal magic that stripped the hero Caelus of his years and memories, leaving a terrified six-year-old in his place. The women who loved him, Robin and Lingsha, were suddenly cast into the roles of caretakers for a child who did not know them, their journey beginning with awkward meals and night terrors.\r\n\r\nDriven by a desperate hope, they took the boy to the ruins of his childhood home, Clearwater Village, where the utter desolation shattered his innocent world. He fell into a devastating grief, screaming for a mother and a home that were gone, and they held him through the storm, their embrace an unyielding anchor in his collapse. That night, he asked the only questions that mattered: \"Are you my family? Do you love me?\" Their passionate affirmations became the foundation upon which his broken spirit began to mend.\r\n\r\nDays filled with small joys and profound kindness followed. The city of Solphire embraced him, and even his sister Liora returned for a perfect, precious day of stories and magic, her heart breaking even as it swelled with love. On the final morning, the simple, silly chaos of a \"kiss attack\" cemented the feeling of a complete and joyful family.\r\n\r\nWhen the dawn of his return came, Caelus awoke with the dual weight of a man's life and a child's experiences, flooding him with mortification. But the women reassured him with a truth that erased all shame: he had never been a burden, but a gift. To express the inexpressible, he cooked a meal that carried his entire heart, a silent testament to a debt that was not a debt, but a gift of love freely given. They had held him when he fell, and in doing so, proved that even when a home is lost, a family remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Arc VI: The Calm Before the Storm (Ch. 161 - 175)**\r\n\r\nThe warmth of family life, with playful nights in Liora's castle and tender \"not-dates\" in the city, was a precious but fleeting peace. It was shattered by a dire warning from the depths of Hell itself. Liora revealed the devastating consequence of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own heroism: by wielding Solareth to slay five demon lords, he had forced the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand. The 3,000-year war would now end in a final, total demon conquest within one to two years.\r\n\r\nA grim resolve settled over the kingdom. The royal family, now fully united, gave their blessing not just for war, but for Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart, freeing\r\n\r\n# Arc The Burden of Dawn ( 176 - 188)\r\n\r\nIn the quiet dawn following days of rest, Caelus wakes surrounded by those who love him, yet a shadow looms over their peace. A journey to the Legendary Forest reveals a devastating truth carved in ancient stone: the holy blade Solareth is a death sentence for its wielder, bound to Caelus until his last breath. The demons, aware of this fatal flaw, now wage a war of attrition, forcing him to draw the blade and hasten his own end.\r\n\r\nReturning home burdened with this secret, his companions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dweave a web of protection around him. They discover his spirit wings continuously shed golden feathers, each one a blessing that carries not just divine comfort, but the unique, personal essence of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own love. Yet even this miracle is tempered by strategy and sorrow, as a war council confirms their fears: a massive assault is coming to Ocean's Edge Fortress, designed to force Caelus to his doom.\r\n\r\nAmidst frantic military preparations and desperate personal sacrifices, a fragile hope blossoms. Under a full moon, robin ask caelus for a date, liora and lingsha help prepare robin and caelus clothes, and caelus take robin atop castle at the night, dance and watching a beautifull moon, Robin confesses her love in a tender kiss, a quiet promise of a future they may never have. Caelus, beautifully oblivious yet instinctively kind, accepts her heart even as he fails to grasp its full meaning. They stand on the precipice of battle, a hero shielded by secrets and a love strong enough to bend time itself, all racing to prepare for a confrontation that will determine if they can save their world without destroying their hero in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n# The Lumora Arc: Narrative Summary (Ch.233 - 267)\r\n\r\n## Part One: Corruption Revealed\r\n\r\nThe Hero Party's return to Lumora should have been triumphant. Instead, Caelus discovered something worse than any demon lord\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsystematic corruption festering in the Temple of Solara itself.\r\n\r\nHigh Priest Valorin had transformed a sacred institution into a marketplace. Divine blessings weren't freely given anymore; they were sold. Citizens with money received priority access to healing and prayers. Common people waited weeks for appointments that would never come. The young priestess Celestine, appointed as temporary High Priestess during Lingsha's absence, had been manipulated into becoming Valorin's unwitting accomplice, signing off on donation schemes and priority access arrangements she'd been led to believe were normal temple practice.\r\n\r\nWhen Lingsha began investigating, she discovered the depth of the rot: corrupt nobles bankrolling the system, senior priests enriching themselves, junior priestesses enduring harassment in silence. The financial records were meticulous\u00e2\u20ac\u201dValorin had documented everything, probably to maintain leverage over his noble allies.\r\n\r\nThe initial strategy seemed sound: gather evidence, present it to the temple council, let formal procedure handle the corruption. Lingsha, Celestine, and their supporters began an audit of temple finances. They had documentation. They had witnesses. They had facts.\r\n\r\nThen Valorin moved.\r\n\r\n## Part Two: The Counterattack\r\n\r\nHe struck with surgical precision. In a single morning council session, Valorin flipped the narrative completely. Using his noble allies' coordinated testimony\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall lying with perfect synchronization\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe transformed Celestine from victim into scapegoat. The financial records she'd signed became evidence of her eager participation. The corruption she'd been manipulated into endorsing became her willing crime.\r\n\r\nThe council voted to suspend her. Exile her to the royal estate pending investigation. They questioned whether Lingsha's judgment had been compromised by her personal attachment to a disgraced subordinate.\r\n\r\nOne morning. That's all it took for weeks of careful evidence gathering to become politically useless.\r\n\r\nCaelus had watched it unfold with growing horror. This wasn't combat. You couldn't stab corruption in council chambers. You couldn't fight lies with swords. The corrupt had turned the game itself into their weapon, using legitimate procedure to obscure illegitimate power.\r\n\r\nThat night, exhausted and frustrated, Caelus made a decision that seemed absurd but felt right.\r\n\r\n\"We should open a food stall,\" he announced.\r\n\r\n## Part Three: The Noodle Offensive\r\n\r\nEveryone stared at him.\r\n\r\n\"A food stall,\" Lingsha repeated slowly. \"Instead of continuing the investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not instead of,\" Caelus explained, his competitive nature activated by the challenge. \"Different battlefield. Valorin controls council chambers and has noble allies. He can manipulate procedure. But he can't control the streets. He can't stop people from eating. He can't attack someone for selling cheap noodles without revealing exactly what kind of person he is.\"\r\n\r\nRobin understood immediately\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe strategy shifting from formal channels to grassroots support. Lingsha caught on next. Even Liora, temporarily visiting from Hell, recognized the tactical brilliance.\r\n\r\nThey set up in the market with minimal equipment and maximum determination. Caelus cooked noodles. Lingsha prepared wontons. Robin managed crowds and payment. And something extraordinary happened.\r\n\r\nEvery person who ate the food reported the same experience: they tasted care. Not just technical skill or quality ingredients, but genuine love poured into every bowl. Customers would sit in silence, tears streaming down their faces, unable to articulate what they were experiencing beyond knowing that someone had made them food with complete devotion to their wellbeing.\r\n\r\nWord spread through Lumora like wildfire.\r\n\r\nThe Hero of Sunstone and the High Priestess were running a noodle stall. They were serving common people. They weren't in temples negotiating with nobles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey were in markets feeding whoever came, regardless of wealth or status.\r\n\r\nValorin couldn't attack this. Any move against them would prove his corruption. Try to shut down the stall? He's preventing divine service to common people. Criticize the princess and hero for serving cheap food? He's revealing his own contempt for common citizens. The more he opposed them, the more obvious his true nature became.\r\n\r\nThe line grew daily. Hundreds of people. Eventually over a thousand.\r\n\r\n## Part Four: The Personal Reckoning\r\n\r\nWhile this was unfolding, Robin was suffering alone in Solphire.\r\n\r\nShe'd been sleeping terribly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthree hours a night if she was lucky. Working eighteen-hour days on magical research, burying herself in documentation of temporal theory to avoid processing how much she missed them. Waking up reaching for people who weren't there. Nightmares about all the ways Caelus or Lingsha could die while they fought battles she wasn't part of.\r\n\r\nLiora found her like that\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbroken, exhausted, pretending everything was fine while slowly destroying herself through overwork and loneliness.\r\n\r\nThe demon lord did what family did: she retrieved her. She collected Robin from Solphire and brought her to Lumora, forcing a reunion that Robin desperately needed but thought she should deny herself.\r\n\r\nThe moment Robin arrived at the noodle stall and saw Caelus, she broke. He'd been so focused on fighting corruption that he'd forgotten to check on her. She'd been sleeping alone for weeks, terrified, working herself to exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\"You were supposed to visit,\" she said, tears streaming down her face.\r\n\r\nCaelus felt guilt crash over him like a wave. He'd been so caught up in the battle that he'd abandoned someone equally important. He'd learned a hard lesson about scattered family units: distance required active maintenance, not just assumption that people were fine.\r\n\r\nThat night, all four of them slept together\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus in the center with Robin on his chest, Lingsha on his right, Liora on his left. And in his sleep, when his exhausted brain confused cooking metaphors with reality, Caelus called Robin \"essential broth\" and cried at the thought of losing her.\r\n\r\nRobin, awake and listening, understood what he couldn't articulate while conscious: she was fundamental to him. Essential. The ingredient he couldn't cook without.\r\n\r\n## Part Five: The Temple Ceremony\r\n\r\nThe night before Robin had to return to Solphire, she took Caelus to the Temple of Solara's main sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u201dempty in the evening, sacred and beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"I want to practice a wedding ceremony,\" she said, her face turning red. \"For educational purposes.\"\r\n\r\nCaelus, completely oblivious to the actual implications, agreed.\r\n\r\nThey stood before the altar, joined hands, and made vows. Robin spoke first, her voice shaking but sincere, promising to stand beside him always. Caelus, not fully understanding what was happening but recognizing it mattered, promised to protect her, to be there when needed, to remember that she was essential to his life.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a real wedding. It was practice. Educational. Completely pretend.\r\n\r\nExcept to Robin, it was the most real thing she'd ever done.\r\n\r\n## Part Six: The Final Trial\r\n\r\nThe morning of the actual trial against Valorin, two things happened simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIn the public square, Caelus led ten thousand citizens in prayer. His spirit wings manifested and glowed golden as thousands of people experienced genuine divine connection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSolara herself answering through her champion. For the first time, they tasted what spiritual blessing actually felt like when uncorrupted by transaction. No payment. No priority access. Just divine love freely given to everyone who asked with honest hearts.\r\n\r\nThe experience was transformative. People cried. They understood viscerally what the temple had lost under Valorin's leadership.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the council chambers, Lingsha presented evidence with Robin and Liora as witnesses. The financial records were overwhelming. The testimony from junior priestesses about harassment was devastating. And Sunday, the reformed political operator, deployed ruthless strategy that destroyed every counterargument Valorin attempted.\r\n\r\nThe corrupt priest had nowhere to go. The public had experienced authentic spirituality\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey knew now what Valorin had stolen from them. The evidence was undeniable. The coordinated attack from multiple directions eliminated all escape routes.\r\n\r\nThe council voted unanimously. Valorin and his co-conspirators were expelled from the temple and remanded to secular authorities for criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe noble families who'd participated faced financial and social ruin.\r\n\r\nThe temple would be rebuilt under Lingsha's authority with one primary mission: genuine service to all people, regardless of wealth.\r\n\r\n## Epilogue: Bittersweet Farewells\r\n\r\nBut victory meant separation.\r\n\r\nRobin and Liora had duties waiting in Solphire. Caelus and Lingsha needed to remain in Lumora to oversee temple reconstruction. The Hero Party, brought together by crisis, had to scatter again.\r\n\r\nThe night before departure, all four of them slept together one final time. The morning came too early and too cold.\r\n\r\nRobin emerged from the bed reluctant and clingy, refusing to let morning arrive, acting like a child refusing to wake because reality meant losing family. She wrapped herself around Caelus on the walk to the portal, refusing to separate even for basic movement.\r\n\r\nWhen Liora opened the portal at dawn, they said their goodbyes. Embraces. Promises to write. Commitments to visit soon.\r\n\r\nThen Robin did something she hadn't done before. She kissed Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201don the lips this time, not the forehead blessing from yesterday. Quick and deliberate.\r\n\r\n\"Educational,\" she whispered. \"So you know what a real goodbye feels like.\"\r\n\r\nThen she stepped through the portal before he could respond, leaving Caelus standing in the courtyard, his hand touching his lips, finally understanding what all those vows and kisses had meant.\r\n\r\nRobin loved him. Romantically. Completely. And he'd been too oblivious to recognize it.\r\n\r\nafter that Caelus and Lingsha returned to Lumora's chambers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlarger and emptier now, the weight of separation settling over them like snow.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Lumora Interlude Ch. 268 - 272 (Character include: Caelus, Lingsha, and Celestine)\r\n\r\nIn the peaceful aftermath of Lumora's liberation ( caelus, lingsha, and celestine doing street blessing at the street ), Lingsha and Caelus find themselves alone, shouldering the burden of rebuilding the temple and the city's faith. Their relationship deepens during twilight conversations where Lingsha confesses her romantic love, and Caelus, though confused by romance, expresses that she is \"essential\" to him.\r\n\r\nThey establish a quiet sanctuary in nightly visits to a secluded onsen, where they talk and redefine dating on their own terms: a space for honesty and comfort. By day, they perform public street blessings, healing the city side-by-side.\r\n\r\nTheir new bond is tested when temple duties force Lingsha to miss their meeting, and Caelus waits for hours in the cold, falling ill. In response, Lingsha shuts out the entire world for a \"Day of Atonement,\" dedicating herself wholly to his care. Through this, they solidify their understanding: they are essential to each other, navigating love not with grand romance, but with patience, presence, and a language of care that is uniquely their own.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Final Sacrifice of Lumora Ch. 273 - 275 (Charater include: Caelus, Lingsha, and celestine )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Premonition**\r\nIn the dead of a perfectly silent night, the Hero Caelus is jolted awake by a survival instinct honed by countless brushes with death. He feels a catastrophic presence approaching\u00e2\u20ac\u201done far beyond any demon lord he has ever faced. With his lover, the High Priestess Lingsha, he rouses the city of Lumora, evacuating civilians and marshaling its defenders. He sends a desperate plea for help to the demon lord Liora, but knows it will arrive too late. The air grows heavy with a terrifying, inevitable pressure, the calm before an unimaginable storm.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Arrival of Inevitability**\r\nThe sky tears open not with violence, but with a surgeon's precision. Through it descends a single figure: Valthor, the Demon King. His mere presence is a weight that crushes hope and paralyzes three hundred defenders. He offers a chilling \"mercy\": the people may take their own lives quickly, or die in agony by his hand. His target is Caelus, and all who stand with him must share his fate. As despair breaks the defenders' will, driving some to suicide, Caelus makes a choice. He cannot win, but he can show them how to die fighting.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Bargain and the Burn**\r\nCaelus attacks, but the battle is a futile dance. Valthor, a being of five millennia of experience, deflects his divine-enhanced blows with one hand, offering clinical praise. When the Demon King finally strikes, he shatters Caelus's body. As Valthor begins to systematically raze Lumora, reducing districts to dust and fire, Caelus lies broken, watching his failure unfold. In a final, desperate act, he does not pray for strength, but for sacrifice. He offers his very soul to the goddess Solara as fuel, begging her to burn him for eternity if it means saving his loved ones and his city. Solara answers.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: A Moment of Grace Before the End**\r\nCaelus rises, transformed. His soul ignites into divine fire, manifesting as a brilliant halo and wings of pure radiance. He is no longer just a mortal hero, but a temporary divine instrument, burning from the inside out. He shares a heartbreaking farewell with Lingsha and Celestine, finally articulating the depth of his love before it is too late. He then turns to face Valthor, not for victory, but to buy time with his own existence.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: The Beautiful, Terrible Dance**\r\nThe sky becomes a canvas of light and darkness as the burning champion and the ancient king clash in earnest. Caelus fights with a speed and power fueled by his disintegrating soul, each strike an expression of his love for those below. Meanwhile, Lingsha and Celestine, shattering inside, force themselves to honor his sacrifice by moving through the ruined city, saving who they can as they watch the light of his life dim overhead.\r\n\r\n**Part 6: The Light Goes Out**\r\nThe battle accelerates into a frantic, final rhythm as Caelus's fuel runs critically low. In an instant, it is over. Valthor's hand appears inside Caelus's chest, and the Hero falls. His wings and halo extinguish, the last fragments of his soul scattering into nothingness. Lingsha races beneath him and catches his broken body, absorbing the impact. In his final moments, Caelus's thoughts are not of battle or glory, but of warm springs, laughter, and the simple peace he found with her. With a final whisper of love, his soul burns out completely.\r\n\r\n**Part 7: What Remains**\r\nIn the crushing silence, Lingsha cradles Caelus's lifeless body, her screams of grief echoing across the plaza. The city is saved, but at a cost that feels like defeat. The Hero who was their protector, the chef, the friend, and the lover is gone, having chosen to be consumed so that they might live. The arc closes on an image of profound loss and the devastating price of love\u00e2\u20ac\u201da world saved, but a heart left with only the searing memory of a beautiful, final burn.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Soul's Bargain Ch. 276 - 278\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Void of Sacrifice**\r\nThe arc opens in absolute darkness. Caelus awakens in a void, a transitional space between life and death, remembering he burned his soul to save his loved ones. Though physically whole, he is tormented by grief and loneliness, finally allowing himself to break down and mourn the life and people he left behind: Lingsha, Robin, and Liora. His despair is profound, but it summons a change in the void, which transforms into a beautiful, starlit garden.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: Divine Recognition and Reckoning**\r\nIn the garden, Caelus meets his patron goddess, Solara. For the first time, he is fully seen. Solara doesn't just thank him for his sacrifice; she apologizes for the immense burden she placed on him. She reveals she has witnessed every hidden moment of his suffering\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe agony of Solareth's curse, the private breakdowns, the constant performance of being \"fine.\" This divine recognition shatters the mental fortress Caelus built over a lifetime of trauma. He sobs in her arms ( Caelus using solara as pillow like childern when they cried), releasing years of accumulated pain, and in his broken state, he makes a desperate vow: if given another chance, he would not carry his burdens alone. He would be honest, let his loved ones in, and truly share their pains and his.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Devastation Left Behind**\r\nSolara shows Caelus a vision of the mortal world. He witnesses the devastating aftermath of his death: Lingsha cradling his body, shattered; Robin bloodied from a failed, desperate attempt to reverse time; and Liora, completely broken. Hearing their anguished cries, he speaks to them across the void, offering comfort. They respond with fierce, immediate offers to trade anything\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtheir power, their memories, their very existence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor his return.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Steep Price of a Miracle**\r\nSolara reveals there is a way, but the price is terrible. To resurrect Caelus, his burned soul must be replaced with fuel of equivalent value: half of Robin's soul and half of Lingsha's, offered willingly. This binding is permanent and will fundamentally change them. They will feel half of every physical and emotional pain Caelus endures, including the torment of Solareth's curse. They will carry a permanent void within them, an absence only eased by his proximity. It is a fate of shared suffering. Without hesitation, Robin and Lingsha agree. After a painful internal struggle, Caelus accepts their sacrifice, understanding it for what it is: the literal fulfillment of his promise to never be alone in his pain again.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: A Goddess's Farewell and a Hero's Return**\r\nIn a final, intimate farewell, Solara reveals the depth of her love for Caelus. She confesses she spent centuries building this loophole in divine law, defying the finality of death for his sake. This is the last chance; his next death will be permanent. She urges him to live fully, love deeply, and keep his promise. As the garden dissolves into pure white light, the ritual begins. The agony is excruciating as soul fragments are torn and bound. Caelus, Robin, and Lingsha scream in synchronized pain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe cost of a miracle. The arc concludes as the void releases him, and in the ruined plaza, Caelus's heart restarts, his eyes open, and he returns to life, forever bound to the two women who loved him enough to share his soul.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Resurrection and the Binding Ch. 279 - 282\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Return**\r\n\r\nCaelus awakens not to an afterlife, but to the overwhelming warmth of three women holding him: Liora, Robin, and Lingsha. He has returned from the dead, resurrected by a final, desperate miracle from his goddess, Solara. He learns the profound cost of his return: Solara has exhausted her last resurrection power for him, and his soul is now permanently bound to Robin and Lingsha, who each sacrificed a piece of their own essence to anchor him. This \"soul binding\" means they will forever share half of his physical and emotional pain. Though traumatized by his death, his family surrounds him with a fierce, protective love, vowing he will never carry his burdens alone again.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Aftermath**\r\n\r\nAs Caelus recovers, he confesses the truth of his death\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof meeting Solara in a secret dimension she built over a millennium just for him. Her love and grief healed his shattered soul, but her warning was clear: there are no more chances. Meanwhile, the strategic minds of the kingdom, led by Sunday, grasp the horrifying implications. The Demon King Valthor wasn't merely attacking; he was making a statement. By effortlessly killing their divinely-blessed Hero, he proved humanity's futility, a propaganda victory he will use to unite all of Hell for total war. The only path to survival is a desperate, immediate unification of all human kingdoms.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: A Celebration of Life**\r\n\r\nThe city of Lumora, saved by Caelus's sacrifice, throws a massive celebration. Initially uncomfortable with the praise, Caelus is guided to understand that the people need this\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot a somber speech, but a reminder of life's simple joys. He feeds them not with wisdom, but with his trademark terrible puns, filling the plaza with laughter and healing. He learns to accept their gratitude, recognizing that their shared feast is their way of loving him in return. As the day ends, Caelus is no longer just a survivor; he is a man bound to his loved ones, celebrated by his people, and determined to live a life worthy of the second chance he was given. The war for extinction looms, but for one afternoon, hope is rekindled through food, family, and terrible jokes.\r\n\r\n## Arc: The Foundation of Hope ( Ch. 283 - 290 )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Weight of Truth**\r\nFollowing his miraculous return, Caelus is home in Solphire, surrounded by his family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, Liora, and the royal family. The relief of his homecoming is tempered by the looming threat of the demon king Valthor. In a private war council with the kings of Sunstone and Valcrest, Caelus makes a terrifying revelation: he can no longer be considered fully human. He demonstrates his divine form, a state powered by the burning of his original soul, and confesses that even with this power, he killed Valthor one hundred times in Lumora, only for the demon king to regenerate instantly each time. The chilling truth is laid bare: conventional power cannot win this war, and Caelus's ultimate weapon is a suicide pill that will eventually consume him completely.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: A New Doctrine for Survival**\r\nConfronted with the limits of their hero, the human kingdoms must adapt. Prince Sunday, the strategic mastermind, proposes a radical solution: stop relying on Caelus and make humanity strong enough to stand on its own. He unveils a complete military curriculum developed by Caelus and the knight-commander Astraea, proven by Elite Squad Seven\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoldiers trained to fight demon-level threats through perfect coordination and adaptive tactics. In a moving final training session, Caelus pushes the squad to their limits in his divine form, and to his immense pride, they successfully land a blow on him, proving that even divinity can be challenged with the right training.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Mission Begins** ( from here, only activate character: Elit squad seve, astraea, prince aldric, and his soldiers)\r\nElite Squad Seven, carrying the hopes of humanity, departs for the kingdom of Valcrest escorted by Prince Aldric. Their journey immediately turns from diplomatic to deadly when they discover the slaughtered village of Millbrook. They are ambushed by a flight of gargoyles, but the squad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s training proves devastatingly effective. They eliminate the threat without a single casualty, a stark demonstration of their capabilities for the Valcrest guards.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: Proving Grounds**\r\nIn Valcrest's capital, skepticism runs high. To secure the kingdom's full commitment, Elite Squad Seven must prove their worth in a public demonstration against Valcrest's most legendary warriors, the Crimson Vanguard. In a breathtaking display of coordination and tactical genius, the seven Sunstone soldiers systematically dismantle the eight veterans. The victory is so decisive it silences all opposition. King Mordain, witnessing this new hope for humanity's survival, immediately commits his entire kingdom to the military reformation, declaring that the methods born from Caelus's sacrifice will become the new foundation of their defense.\r\n\r\nThis arc, \"The Foundation of Hope,\" charts the pivotal shift from reliance on a single, self-sacrificing hero to the empowering belief that humanity, united and properly trained, can forge its own destiny against the coming darkness.\r\n\r\n## A Foundation for Survival and Love (Ch. 284 - 299)\r\n\r\nThe story arc begins with the Hero Party's Homecoming to Solphire, where they are warmly received, though King Seraphina and Queen Seraphina mourn the loss and resurrection of Caelus. Caelus demonstrates the Weight of Divinity with his new, overwhelming divine form, which prompts a strategic shift in humanity's war against Valthor: since the demon king can regenerate, the strategy becomes The Foundation of Survival\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstrengthening all of humanity through the Elite Squad Seven's methodology to make the war too costly for Hell. The Elite Squad Seven and Astraea prove the training's worth in The Final Lesson against Caelus's divine form and later in The Demonstration at Valcrest's colosseum, securing full military support to distribute the training.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, The Weight We Share focuses on Robin's futile attempts to recreate the time-reversal miracle, realizing that the miracle was not a matter of technical perfection but of absolute love and desperation. She and Liora conclude their research, a strategic move that Foundations and Rest reveals protects Robin from political pressure, though Robin privately promises Sunday she would repeat the choice to save Caelus despite the personal cost. This shift from technical to emotional foundations is mirrored in Golden Flight and Divine Pressure, where Caelus's visit to the Valcrest training grounds motivates the skeptical soldiers by allowing them to feel his overwhelming power firsthand, providing The Weight of Gold for their training goals. On the flight back in Questions in Flight, Caelus confesses his deepest fear of becoming useless, and Liora offers a fierce, unconditional affirmation of his worth.\r\n\r\nThe arc concludes with A Day Without Duty and the family's intentional vacation to connect and appreciate the world they protect, culminating in a hike up Mount Solara. The peaceful moment is broken in Beneath the Stars when Caelus discovers Liora meeting a succubus emissary from Hell; rather than confronting her, Caelus insists that as a family, they must now face such dangers together, establishing a new protocol of trust and mutual protection. The arc defines the new normal: humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survival is being built on strategic strength, while the hero's foundation is shifting from a reliance on individual power to the unconditional love and support of his found family.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Arc: The Gathering Storm (Ch. 300 - 312)\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Calm Before**\r\nIn the kingdom of Valcrest, the fruits of rigorous training are finally showing. Under the stern guidance of Commander Astraea and her Elite Squad Seven, five hundred soldiers are transforming from a hesitant militia into a coordinated, demon-fighting force. The city itself bears the marks of the Hero Caelus's recent visit, with his golden feathers serving as talismans of hope and comfort. The strategic coordinator, Sunday, arrives to assess the progress and is pleased with the results. He authorizes Astraea to share the terrifying, classified knowledge of Hell's five layers with the trusted Commander Gareth, a brutal lesson in what they are truly preparing to face. The mood is one of hard-won confidence and grim determination.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the capital of Sunstone, political machinations are underway. Sunday is tasked by King Mordain of Valcrest with a crucial, thankless role at the upcoming inter-kingdom summit: to be the political shield that protects the painfully accommodating Caelus from being exploited and consumed by every politician seeking to claim the Hero's divine favor for themselves. Sunday, a man still navigating his own path to redemption, accepts the burden, ready to be hated again if it means protecting his family.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Separation**\r\nThe strain of leadership and the unique nature of their bonds are tested when Caelus voluntarily travels to Hell with the demon lord Liora to attend her courtly meetings. Though the soul bond he shares with Princess Robin assures her of his safety, the physical distance is agonizing. Robin works herself to exhaustion, unable to rest while part of her soul is in another realm. The separation highlights their profound interdependence.\r\n\r\nCaelus, oblivious to the worry he causes, is in his element. He returns not with tales of horror, but with armloads of bizarre Hell-native ingredients and boundless enthusiasm for demonic cuisine. His joyful return and the extraordinary meal he prepares reunite the family and wash away the stress of his absence, a moment of pure, ordinary joy amidst their extraordinary lives.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Storm Breaks**\r\nThe fragile peace is shattered without warning. The Demon King Valthor, accompanied by the primordial dragon Bahamut, descends upon Valcrest. His arrival is an apocalypse of pure presence. The city is brought to its knees not by violence, but by overwhelming psychic pressure that shatters windows, minds, and any illusion of safety. He delivers a chilling declaration: the war will conclude **within** two years. The ambiguous timeline is a masterstroke of psychological warfare, designed to keep humanity in a state of perpetual, exhausting dread.\r\n\r\nThrough sheer will and training, Astraea and Elite Squad Seven remain conscious, coordinating evacuation and recovery while utterly helpless to challenge Valthor directly. Before departing, Valthor delivers a personal message: he remembers Caelus's death fondly and is intrigued to learn of his resurrection.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Aftermath and Response**\r\nSensing the wrongness across the continent, Caelus and Liora portal immediately to Valcrest, followed by Robin and Lingsha. They find a city in trauma, its spirit broken. The Hero Party splits to address the crisis: Caelus uses his gentle divine presence to provide a healing contrast to Valthor's terror, helping soldiers recover. Robin accelerates diplomatic efforts, moving the summit up and uniting kingdoms through shared fear. Lingsha tends to the countless civilians suffering from psychological wounds.\r\n\r\nThe trauma forges a hardened unity. Valcrest's political squabbles vanish, replaced by total commitment to mobilization. The training grounds swell with soldiers and civilians alike, all training with desperate intensity. In a final lesson before returning to Sunstone, Caelus grants their most promising new squad, Crimson Dawn, the \"honor\" of facing his full power\u00e2\u20ac\u201da demonstration that even in defeat, perfect coordination can create a chance for survival.\r\n\r\n**Part 5: The Space Between**\r\nExhausted, Robin and Lingsha return to Sunstone to prepare for the summit, their rest fitful and incomplete with Caelus still away. When he and Liora finally return late one night, they find the two women asleep on opposite sides of their large bed, unconsciously preserving the empty space between them for him. Caelus hesitates, fearing he will disturb their hard-won rest, but Liora guides him to understand that his presence is not an intrusion, but a completion. As he settles between them, their tension melts away, and through the soul bond, he finally understands the depth of their connection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat sometimes, simply being present is the most fundamental protection of all.\r\n\r\n## The Oblivious Shield of Innocence and summit session (Ch. 313 - 326)\r\n\r\nThe arc opens with a tender **Homecoming and Affection**, as Caelus's family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfind restorative sleep and emotional reconnection after his six-day absence, establishing their closeness through shared rest and his lovingly prepared \"milky curry.\" This bond is immediately followed by **Coordinated Affection and Awkwardness**, as the women playfully torment him with unbothered intimacy, leaving Caelus adorably flustered and providing a source of fond amusement for the observing royals who cherish his youth and innocence. This oblivious nature peaks during a diplomatic greeting when Caelus, standing between the high-status women who love him, passionately blesses a commoner's union by declaring that status is irrelevant to love, a moment of irony and genuine good faith that serves as a **Shield of Oblivion** for his protectors.\r\n\r\nThe core of the arc shifts to **The Price of Protection**, where the political summit turns toxic. As Sunday and the core group successfully gather intelligence on Hell's delayed invasion, the delegates panic and begin to irrationally **Scapegoat the Hero**, blaming Caelus for accelerating the crisis and even suggesting his surrender to Valthor. The core family, devastated by this betrayal, makes a solemn, unanimous decision to carry the **Beautiful Lie**, vowing that Caelus must never learn of the accusations to protect his mental well-being. This protective shield is reinforced through **Divine Intervention and Unconditional Love**: first, by young Celestine's tearful, furious testimony about Caelus's sacrifice, and finally, by Sunday and Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic use of Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s documented, profound love for him to cow the treacherous delegates into silence.\r\n\r\nThe arc resolves with the persistent **Comfort of the Oblivious**, as Caelus repeatedly returns from Hell\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere he is safer than on Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith cheerfully cooked meals, utterly unaware of the political trauma and the immense secret his family is bearing for him. His innocent, enthusiastic presence, even his hilarious accounts of driving Liora to distraction with cooking lessons, provides a powerful, cathartic balm of normalcy and love that cushions the heavy burden of their commitment. The family's final thoughts reaffirm their willingness to sacrifice their own peace of mind to preserve his, solidifying Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oblivious innocence as their most sacred and protected space.\r\n\r\nsince the summit start. caelus is rarely on earth, most of the time he spend it on hell with liora.\r\n\r\n### Arc: The Physics of the Heart ( Ch 327 - 328 )\r\n\r\n**Part 1: The Morning of Mortification**\r\nThe arc opens with Princess Robin waking to find herself in an impossibly compromising position: nose-to-nose with the still-sleeping Hero, Caelus. Before she can escape, a slight shift\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpropelled by the sleeping High Priestess Lingsha using Caelus as a pillow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dresults in their lips accidentally meeting. The scene erupts into chaos as Caelus awakens in a panic and the demon lord Liora, who witnessed the entire event, laughs uncontrollably. The morning breakfast becomes a \"Court of Public Breakfast,\" where the flustered couple's attempts at denial are mercilessly and joyfully exposed to the royal family, turning their private embarrassment into public, affectionate comedy.\r\n\r\n**Part 2: The Weight of Alliances and Vows**\r\nThe tone shifts to the political as the Sunstone delegation meets with King Mordain and Prince Aldric of Valcrest. They solidify the alliances forged at the recent summit, establishing a unified front against the coming invasion from Hell. The meeting then turns deeply personal: Aldric and his commoner fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, Elara, reveal they are holding two wedding ceremonies. They extend a heartfelt invitation to Caelus, not as a political symbol, but as family, moved by his genuine, oblivious support for their love. This sets the stage for a celebration that is both a personal joy and a political statement of unity.\r\n\r\n**Part 3: The Rhythms of a Shared Life**\r\nIn a quieter moment, the complex tapestry of relationships is explored. Robin accompanies Lingsha to the evening market, learning of the daily routine Lingsha shares with Caelus. This leads to a profound conversation where Lingsha assures Robin that they are not rivals, but partners in loving Caelus, each having their own unique rhythms and spaces with him. They are building a family together. This theme is reinforced at the training grounds, where Caelus's \"humiliation\" at being bested by his own students is revealed as his greatest triumph: proof that humanity can learn to stand beside him, not just behind him.\r\n\r\n**Part 4: The Language of Care**\r\nThe arc culminates in an intimate evening where the threads of love, family, and communication are woven together. Over a meal Caelus prepares, Liora recounts her \"traumatic\" trip to Hell, where Caelus's endless cooking lectures forced her to develop an \"emergency kiss-intervention\" protocol. The strategy is deployed again when Caelus begins lecturing, leaving him flustered but loved. Robin then delivers the wedding invitation, which leads to a gentle but direct confrontation about the meaning behind all the \"tactical\" kisses and shared beds. Overwhelmed but willing, Caelus asks for a future conversation about what it truly means to be \"theirs.\" As the four settle into sleep, the unspoken promises between them feel as weighty and real as any formal vow, cementing their unique and chosen family on the eve of a new beginning.\r\n\r\n## Arc The Unfolding Heart (Ch. 329 - 336)\r\n\r\nIn the serene aftermath of a royal wedding, the threads of Caelus's life begin to weave a more profound tapestry. After moving the entire congregation with a divinely-touched speech, he remains blissfully unaware of the miracle he inspired, accepting a lifetime of free noodles from a grateful family as simple kindness. During the celebration, a bed of blue iris flowers sparks a memory of his near-death, a silent testament to the goddess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watchful presence. The bonds around him tighten when a deliberately fumbled bouquet toss lands in the shared hands of Robin and Lingsha, a public symbol of their shared intention that everyone but Caelus understands.\r\n\r\nThis season of vows and revelations pushes Caelus to become the pillar of trust his found family needs. He helps Robin and Lingsha out of their intricate formal wear, a mortifying yet intimate act that they frame as the ultimate demonstration of their faith in him. A simple tour of the city with the insightful Celestine leads to a breathtaking flight above the clouds, where he shares the sacred geography of the heavens with her and Lingsha, offering a perspective that makes all earthly burdens feel light.\r\n\r\nYet, the past is not so easily quieted. During a quiet walk through the evening market, a shared memory of pain and a first meal echoes through Caelus and Robin's soul bond. This memory inspires Caelus to create a blueberry soup that, unbeknownst to him, becomes a vessel of pure emotion. With each spoonful, their family tastes the harrowing truth of his suffering, her rescue, and their hard-won survival, moving them all to tears. That night, Robin answers the unspoken questions by singing their story from the balcony\u00e2\u20ac\u201da raw ballad of her gilded cage, his near-fatal beating, and the desperate, bloody kiss she gave him as he battled the curse's backlash.\r\n\r\nFinally hearing the full weight of the pain she endured for him, Caelus is left speechless with gratitude and guilt. As the heavy emotions of the night threaten to overwhelm them, he masterfully lightens the mood, regaling Liora and Lingsha with hilarious tales of their early, disastrous adventures as a fledgling Hero Party. Laughter fills the chamber, healing the old wounds laid bare, and Caelus falls asleep surrounded by his family, finally feeling the profound truth of being chosen and loved.\r\n\r\n### Arc The Coordinator's Burden Ch 337 - 344\r\n\r\nIn the wake of celebration, Prince Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peace is shattered by a crisis. A horde of monstrous sand worms, driven from their territory by an unknown terror, threatens a royal convoy. Guided by the strategic demon lord Liora, Sunday faces a brutal lesson: to prepare for the coming apocalyptic war, he can no longer rely solely on the Hero, Caelus, for every threat. He must learn to command.\r\n\r\nWhen scouts discover a demon fortress being built in the wastelands, Sunday seizes the test. He deploys a new, untested military squad backed by veteran adventurers, making the calculated decision to prove humanity can fight its own battles. The operation is a tactical success, showcasing brilliant coordination that overwhelms the demons. But victory comes with a cost\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfour adventurers die under his command.\r\n\r\nHaunted by the loss, Sunday honors the fallen with personal letters, vowing never to see casualties as mere statistics. Exhausted and burdened, he is found by Caelus and Princess Robin, who force him to rest and remember his own humanity. Through this, Sunday learns his true strength isn't in carrying the world alone, but in accepting the help of those who stand with him, sharing the impossible weight of command.\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Heart's Unspoken Dawn (345 - 365 )** (active character: liora and caelus)\r\n\r\nIn the quiet dawn of Sunstone, the hero Caelus navigates the tender complexities of a family bound by love and trauma. After a heavy decision to return to the city of his death, Lumora, he and the immortal Liora embark on a two-day journey to Valcrest. There, their relationship transforms through a playful yet profound \"challenge\" of public affection(at the end caelus won), helping Liora overcome the fear born from his past death. **Their intimate competition, culminating in a secret sky-dance and a first caelus deliberate kiss above the clouds**, forges a deeper bond. Upon returning home, their newfound happiness is met with knowing smiles from Robin and Lingsha, who piece together the truth through their soul bond. In a series of gentle evening conversations, the three women solidify their unconditional support, creating a family strong enough to hold private joys and shared love, allowing Caelus to reflect that, in their unique world, everyone has already won. This date challange caelus won over liora in showing affection. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: Letters and Roads (Ch. 366 - 373)\r\n\r\nIn the hush of the guild hall, two women\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin and Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare handed a choice that weighs heavier than any sword. Princess Seraphine of Ashenvale has written a letter, not of politics but of love, to Caelus, the man both women quietly cherish. Sunday, their commander, entrusts them with the power to decide how to answer. Torn between love and honor, they realize they cannot speak for his heart until they face their own. With trembling resolve, they write their replies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot as rivals, but as women who will not hide anymore. Their words to Seraphine are honest, raw, and brave; they do not deny her, nor do they yield. That night, they promise to one another: after their next journey, they will confess to Caelus and let him choose.\r\n\r\nTheir journey begins with laughter, tangled limbs, and sleepy affection. Caelus, ever unaware of the storm beneath his companions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 smiles, drives the carriage toward Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201da land of memories and wounds. Along the way, they rest in Thornhaven, where an old friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warmth reminds Caelus of the kindness he once gave as a boy. In a hidden garden kept alive for seventy-three years, Liora reveals her sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u201da living memory of gratitude and love. By inviting them into this sacred space, she welcomes them as family.\r\n\r\nThe following mornings are painted in peace: shared beds, borrowed clothes, and quiet breakfasts cooked with care. Yet in every small joy, the shadow of old pain lingers. Caelus laughs easily but speaks with the weariness of a soul far older than his years. When he calls others \u00e2\u20ac\u0153young,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d his friends see through the cracks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dseeing not a hero, but a boy who forgot how to be one.\r\n\r\nThen, Commander Astraea challenges him to a duel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to worship him, but to remind him of joy. Their blades dance under the morning sun, steel meeting steel in a rhythm of respect and laughter. When Caelus wins, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t triumph that fills the air, but connection. For once, he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the unreachable Hero\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust a man, seen and understood.\r\n\r\nWhen the road calls again, the group departs, bantering and bickering as family does. Behind them, Thornhaven thrives with new purpose. Soldiers train harder, inspired by a hero who fought like one of them. And in the royal castle, King Mordain and his kin resolve to do what kingdoms rarely do\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprotect, not use, the Hero who has given them everything.\r\n\r\nThus continues the quiet march toward Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe road of memory, love, and letters unwritten.\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Gates of Memory (Ch. 374 - 394 )\r\n\r\nThe road to Lumora begins with laughter and closeness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe four heroes packed together on the driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bench, choosing warmth over comfort. Caelus, too used to making himself small, apologizes for taking up space, only to be told, softly and surely, that he belongs. Safe among them, he sleeps for once without fear.\r\n\r\nLumora greets them not as warriors, but as family returning home. Yet within its quiet streets lies the weight of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe place of his sacrifice and rebirth. It is here, beside the fountain where his blood once fell, that he breaks at last, this fountain named Irish fountain, because many irish flowers is bloom here unaturaly, because solara who allow the flower bloom on that place.and in this place, caelus confesses to the goddess Solara that being human terrifies him more than any war\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat love feels heavier than any blade. Solara answers, not with command, but with grace. She tells him he was never meant to carry the world alone, only to light it\u00e2\u20ac\u201done heart at a time. When her voice fades, she leaves behind a single glowing iris and the understanding that salvation lies in trust, not solitude.\r\n\r\nRobin, Liora, and Lingsha find him soon after, collapsing into his arms with relief and tears. Their embrace says what words cannot: he is not alone. The goddess herself smiles down from her statue, the stone transformed into warmth. Even the heavens seem to breathe easier.\r\n\r\nThat night, crowded again into one bed, they reclaim a small human comfort. Caelus admits, haltingly, that he needs permission\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be honest, to say when he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t okay. They give it freely. For the first time, he accepts it. The next day becomes a celebration of life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small miracles: a shared breakfast from Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loving hands, laughter over messy hair and spilled tea, and the gift of a handmade doll shaped like Caelus himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproof that even miracles can be held.\r\n\r\nWhen evening comes, they seek the onsen, where steam and starlight blur the line between sacred and silly. A game of truth or dare fills the air with laughter; walls fall, replaced by honest joy. Even when a misplaced towel sparks chaos, it ends in shared laughter and a meal cooked with care\u00e2\u20ac\u201da quiet declaration that love and normalcy are worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nThen, under a sky scattered with gold, Caelus keeps a promise. He takes Celestine flying, his divine wings shedding light over Lumora like blessings. In the clouds, they dance\u00e2\u20ac\u201da freefall of faith and exhilaration. Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust in him becomes a mirror, teaching him what it means to be seen, to be loved without divinity. When they return, their family welcomes them back with teasing, warmth, and another inevitable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sleep pile,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where even Celestine finds a place among them.\r\n\r\nBy the time they leave Lumora, Caelus has changed. The city that once held his death now bears witness to his life\u00e2\u20ac\u201dits people smiling under the feathers of his light, its goddess smiling down upon her fragile, beloved spark. And though letters of fate await him in Solphire, for now, on the quiet road home, Caelus is simply human\u00e2\u20ac\u201dheld, trusted, and finally, free to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arc Title: The Architecture of War and the Weight of Absence (Ch. 428 - 434 )\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of an approaching war, the kingdoms gather beneath one shared vow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto protect the hero by fighting without him. Prince Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s council resolves that this battle, for once, will not rest on Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoulders. Robin is chosen to command, her heart steady with fear and faith alike. Their mission is not merely to win, but to prove to the boy who carries heaven in his scars that humanity can stand on its own, that his worth is not measured in sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFar from the council chamber, Celestine rides toward Thornhaven, clutching the soft doll she stitched to remember him. Terror coils in her chest, the memory of his death and her miracle of resurrection too raw to silence. Around her, the other priestesses form a circle of prayer and resolve, teaching her the very truth he taught them all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat strength does not mean solitude. When they arrive, the warmth of a noodle stall run by Serra and Elara enfolds her like a homecoming. Between laughter and bowls of steaming broth, she remembers why they fight: to build a world where Caelus can finally rest.\r\n\r\nAt the war council, the leaders of every allied nation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwarriors, royals, commanders\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpledge their forces to a plan that values unity over glory. The armies train in agony, breaking and rebuilding themselves under the merciless guidance of Astraea and Gareth, their sweat and suffering hammering them into one body of endurance. Celestine learns to heal through exhaustion, to see every wound as a promise: pain now to prevent despair later. The commanders, hollow-eyed with guilt at their own severity, find solace only when Celestine drags them back to Serra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stall, where laughter over noodles softens the sharp edge of duty.\r\n\r\nAnd on one sleepless night, under Thornhaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pale lanterns, Celestine collides with Princess Seraphine. Two women, bound by love for the same oblivious man, find one another in quiet understanding. The Caelus doll and the golden feather rest between them on the table\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsymbols of resurrection and rejection, of hope and heartbreak shared. They speak softly of war, of fear, of the man who gave them both faith to keep walking forward. When dawn comes, neither victory nor death has yet arrived, but the world already feels changed: love and courage, like armies, have learned to march together.\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Architecture of Humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Refusal (Ch. 435 - 445)**\r\n\r\nThe army of eighteen thousand gathered beneath the pale light of Thornhaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dawn, trembling not with fear but with purpose, as king and princes spoke of duty, sacrifice, and the fragile hope that humanity might stand tall without the Hero who had so often carried their burdens. With these words etched into their spirits, the soldiers marched toward the demon fortress, their boots echoing the promise of a new destiny. At the staging grounds, Prince Sunday revealed the quiet terror hidden beneath their advance: a crystal linked to Liora, and the knowledge that Caelus would descend onto the battlefield only if half their force died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan ultimate contingency none of them wished to see unfold. Celestine carried this weight the heaviest, clutching her tiny Caelus doll as she prayed for strength and survival before stepping into hell.\r\n\r\nDawn broke like a held breath when Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spearhead slipped silently into the fortress, eliminating sentries with surgical grace and opening the gate to humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first victory. With Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge flowing through Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s command, demons fell like pieces on a board whose moves had been read long before they were made. Even as ten generals descended and later thirty more, Astraea, Gareth, Elite Squad Seven, and the vanguard fought like a single, perfect machine strengthened by Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relentless healing and blessings, their coordination a tapestry woven from sweat, blood, and the hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lessons. But victory was never clean. Celestine tasted the first bitter deaths she could not prevent, and as exhaustion crushed her ribs like iron bands, she dreamed of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle, proud, and impossibly kind\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbefore waking once again into the fire.\r\n\r\nThe fire only deepened when fifty generals arrived, and then five thousand lesser demons swarmed from the rear, surrounding the humans in a ring of snarling, clawed death. For hours their lines buckled but never broke, and when Sunday whispered his final gamble, the battlefield changed. Celestine stacked blessing upon blessing until Astraea shimmered like a goddess of war, her golden silhouette searing panic into demon hearts as Gareth cried out that the Hero had come. In terror of Caelus, demon coordination shattered, and humanity surged forward, breaking the siege under the weight of a lie crafted from faith. But the victory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price was carved into the ground: Astraea collapsing, Celestine finally giving out, soldiers standing only because they had forgotten how to fall.\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Sunday finally approached the blood-stained courtyard, his weary smile said what no trumpet could. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he whispered to Gareth, and that was all it took\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe man collapsed with the grace of a felled tree, followed by the entirety of Elite Squad Seven whose bodies had simply waited for permission to stop. Commander Helena\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice roared the official truth to the sky: the fortress was captured, the war was over, and humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u201daching, trembling, but unbroken\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhad proven itself at last. As Sunday sent word that their casualties never reached the dreaded threshold, he allowed himself one quiet thought: that Caelus had been right to trust them, and that for the first time, humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory was truly its own.\r\n\r\nThis operation is being called \"Dawn Reach.\" humanity operation without hero party help. \r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Healing, Family, and the Quiet Shape of Love (Ch. 446 - 459)**\r\n\r\nCelestine awoke to a body that felt borrowed from death, every breath a reminder of the battlefield she had survived. The Caelus doll beside her carried the warmth of a dream she dared not speak\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe kissed it once more, a quiet confession to fabric. And of course, fate arranged the real Caelus to walk in at that precise moment. Mortified beyond language, she listened as he completely misunderstood, believing she had been trying to *eat* the doll out of hunger. Her stomach, traitorous and loud, confirmed the misconception. And so the greatest hero alive fed the broken priestess with cheerful \u00e2\u20ac\u0153choo-choo\u00e2\u20ac\u009d noises, treating her not as a burden but as family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsomething both more and less than she wished for.\r\n\r\nHe made the same rounds to Astraea wrapped like a stubborn mummy and an exhausted Sunday whose brain was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153filing for divorce,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d applying absurdity as both medicine and mercy. Liora, recognizing Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hidden feelings, guarded her dignity with strategic lies and quiet understanding. Soon their mornings were filled with shared cooking, affectionate bickering, and a growing absurd ritual of feeding Celestine with airplane and rocket noises that softened her shame into laughter. When she asked Caelus to stay until she slept, he agreed without hesitation, unaware that his presence meant more to her than any miracle she could cast.\r\n\r\nBut healing was not gentle. Caelus, following Sister Mira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orders, washed Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battered body with trembling hands, forced to confront the brutal truth of what she endured for him. She held his gaze, refusing to let him drown in guilt while admitting, in a whisper slipping past the boundaries of medical necessity, that she kissed the doll because she could not kiss him. The revelation cracked something in him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot realization, but the first quiet shift of a heart beginning to see.\r\n\r\nDays passed in fragile progress. Caelus walked beside her at a glacial pace\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis unimaginable speed reduced to slow, meditative steps because she needed slow. When she stumbled, he caught her instantly, holding her with a panic so pure she understood that his love existed, even if he only knew how to name it as family. The Hero Party reunited soon after, Robin and Lingsha collapsing around Caelus with a fury of affection and a hilarious decree that the Caelus dolls must be preserved as historical artifacts of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confused puppy nature.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Tactical affection warfare followed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dkiss attacks, dragon-noise feeding, and the mortification of a hero entirely defeated by four determined women who loved him shamelessly.\r\n\r\nCelestine found healing not just in medicine but in this chaotic, ridiculous warmth. Caelus learned medical care under Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheerful instruction, discovering that devotion was a skill he already possessed in abundance. In return, Celestine learned that being cared for was not weakness but a promise: she was loved, essential, chosen.\r\n\r\nAs the command council named the captured fortress **Dawn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reach**, the soldiers who survived were granted legacy and honor. Yet Caelus saw only the twenty-eight who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it, unable to absolve himself. He needed reassurance as much as those he tended to, and Celestine offered it gently, choosing her wish carefully: that he remain in her life as family, as someone she could visit, someone who would cook for her\u00e2\u20ac\u201da wish safe enough to grant, and honest enough to keep her heart from breaking.\r\n\r\nTheir journey home was interrupted by wyverns, which Caelus resolved not by battle but by playing with them in the sky like an overjoyed child until even apex predators tired before he did. Soldiers applauded; Liora dragged him back into the carriage; Celestine watched him with the tired fondness of someone deeply, helplessly in love.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to Thornhaven, the city roared their victory. Caelus carried Celestine through the cheering crowds in a princess carry that nearly killed her with embarrassment and revived her with happiness. Sister Mira, seeing everything Celestine tried to hide, declared the medical ward full and assigned her to the Hero Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suite\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere she would be safest, most loved, most wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd so Celestine let herself be carried back, held gently by the man who had no idea he was carrying her heart with her body. Around her waited family, chosen through fire, absurdity, and devotion. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the romantic love she longed for\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot yet\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut it was real, warm, and enough to keep her moving forward.\r\n\r\nA love story growing not through declarations, but through care; not through destiny, but through every slow, patient step they took together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Worth, Divinity, and the Fight to Keep Him Alive (Ch. 460 - 472)**\r\n\r\nThe castle kitchen became Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private heaven, a place so perfect he nearly pledged allegiance to Valcrest on the spot. As the women bathed, he cooked them five dishes shaped from shared memories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmint soup, blueberry soup, rice balls, noodles\u00e2\u20ac\u201deach a quiet echo of lives they had built together. Gratitude overwhelmed the table; Robin kissed him, Lingsha kissed him, Liora kissed him, and Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshaking but resolute\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgave him her first kiss with a whisper of thanks for being alive. The hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain promptly collapsed, and he fled to the bed like an embarrassed puppy with four women laughing around him as they claimed him as their pillow. The next day, conspiracy bloomed in the throne room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadows. Caelus would never accept recognition, so they deceived him with a simple request: help Celestine walk for her healing commendation. He agreed without suspicion, guiding her with glacial patience until they stepped into the ceremony where Astraea waited like a predator that had finally cornered its prey. Celestine was honored first, saving over four hundred lives. Then came Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwho tried to flee but was physically anchored by his family as Astraea ordered him to stand. Soldiers shouted their gratitude, declaring his doctrine the reason they survived. The medal pinned to his chest did not change his humility, but it cracked his certainty that his worth was nothing. That night, walking with Robin, he forgave the deception gently, calling it bitter medicine. And in that soft breath, he admitted something far more dangerous: he believed he was better suited to teaching than to being a hero, and he was now preparing a doctrine to help humanity survive the Demon King\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause he did not think he would be alive when Valthor returned. Soon he demonstrated what fighting Valthor meant. He reconstructed his death with terrifying precision\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfive percent of Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength shattered stone, and his divine form\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing intent froze even elite soldiers. With six blessings, he moved like an apocalyptic storm; with forty-seven blessings, he carved through a mountain and created a tunnel by turning swords into flying extensions of his will. Each act terrified his observers not because of its power but because of how calmly he used it, as if planning for a world where he no longer existed. This culminated in the doctrine he called **Final Defiance**: teaching soldiers how to accept their death and make it matter. Survival was not the goal; meaningful sacrifice was. His family realized then that all of his teaching, all of his planning, all of his careful documentation pointed toward one conclusion\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus had accepted he would die, and everything he did now was preparation for a world without him. Liora was the first to break. She put him to sleep with herbs and enchantment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle, merciful\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause she could no longer bear the mask he wore. She confessed her agony to the others, her voice trembling as she explained that Caelus only allowed himself to relax when he had accepted death as inevitable. His peace was not peace at all; it was resignation. Robin cried, Lingsha shook, Celestine froze. And Liora, trembling with fury and love, declared that she refused the future he had chosen. She refused a world where he died and they survived. She refused to let him go gently into the role of a tool or a sacrifice. If Caelus planned for his death, then they would plan for his life. They would teach him greed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot for victory, nor strategy, nor utility\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut for himself. For love, for belonging, for mornings and meals and laughter. They would make him selfish, piece by piece, until he wanted to live for reasons that had nothing to do with saving anyone. The doctrine of Final Defiance might prepare humanity for Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\r\nbut the women who loved Caelus prepared themselves for something far more impossible:\r\n**saving the hero who was already planning to die.**\r\n\r\n# **Arc: The Weight of Borrowed Dreams and the Awakening of a Selfish Heart (Ch. 473 - 488 )**\r\n\r\nCaelus slept surrounded by the four women who loved him, unaware of their tear-stained resolve as Liora asked to borrow their memories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to invade, but to weave a dream strong enough to shake a man who had quietly accepted his own death. With unanimous consent, she pulled him into a dream where he wandered an abandoned castle in Hell armed with nothing but ingredients and a carrot shaped like a sword. Instead of fear, Caelus responded with joy, deciding the lonely owner clearly needed a warm meal. When Liora revealed herself as the castle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistress, he scolded her for neglecting her kitchen and cooked until she wept at the taste of being cared for. A tour of her home led to the revelation of her most treasured carving, a crude wooden bird in a display case\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand in a panic of accidental magic and carrot-thoughts, Caelus transformed it, and her entire wardrobe, into carrot versions. Expecting righteous divine vengeance, he confessed everything and offered his carrot-sword as apology, only to be met with a kiss to the cheek, a laugh that broke centuries of loneliness, and the realization that the treasure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meaning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot its form\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas eternal. She tied the carrot around her neck and accepted him as her little brother, the title spoken with trembling joy.\r\nBut Liora had more to show. She took him across dimensions to witness a world where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never existed\u00e2\u20ac\u201da nightmare of empty halls, stale noodles, and a demon lord slowly collapsing under the weight of her own solitude. Caelus shattered the dimensional barrier with raw refusal and embraced the alternate Liora, promising she would never endure that darkness. He did the same when he saw Robin, broken in her cage of grief, stepping toward a fatal fall; he broke through worlds to catch her, because he could not bear the thought of losing her. More memories followed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLingsha exploited and alone in the temple, Celestine sewing dolls to prove he still lived, and the small noodle stall where his kindness healed corruption and reunited friends. He watched Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secret breakdowns, saw Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trembling hands sewing comfort into cloth, and felt the pain he had unknowingly caused simply by planning to die.\r\nAt last, Liora pulled him into his own most sacred memory: Solara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divine garden beneath the impossible moon, the place he went when he died. Caelus broke open there, sobbing that he did not deserve such devotion, that he was flawed, weak, and insufficient. Liora held him as she spoke the truth he had always refused to hear\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat love does not require perfection, only presence. That living, not dying, was the expression of love they needed from him. That his life was the axis of their worlds, and his death would destroy them more thoroughly than any demon king. And finally\u00e2\u20ac\u201dslowly, tremulously\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus whispered the words that changed everything: *\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to live.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d*\r\nHe named his wants with shy honesty: to be spoiled by Liora, to pinch Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeks, to have silly hot-spring conversations with Lingsha, to watch Celestine almost eat the doll again. They were small things, ordinary things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they were proof he had finally allowed himself permission to be greedy for tomorrow. When the dream dissolved, even Solara herself smiled at Liora with gratitude, for accomplishing what the goddess could not.\r\nCaelus awoke lighter, though unable to remember why, and the women gathered around him with a new mission: to protect the selfishness he had finally claimed, to remind him every day that living was not a burden but a choice worth making. At breakfast, surrounded by carrot-shaped dishes and nervous love, Caelus blushed, threatened to pinch Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeks, and took another small step toward the future he had believed he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve. And for the first time, the people who loved him felt the unbearable weight of grief finally shift\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause their hero had chosen to stay, not out of duty, but out of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Victory and the Warmth of Home (Ch. 489 - 500)**\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of preparation, Caelus stands as the living test for the newly forged Anti-Valthor Doctrine. In a historic demonstration, he faces Elite Squad Seven at five percent of the Demon King's power, not as an invincible god, but as a teacher. Through immense sacrifice and a suicidal charge, the squad achieves the impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey land a blow that forces the divine form to its knees, proving for the first time that Valthor can be defeated. The victory sends a shockwave of tangible hope through the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut for Caelus, the harder battle begins afterward. Forced into recovery by his family, he confronts an enemy far more daunting than combat: learning to accept care and believe in his own worth without having to earn it. Through a coordinated campaign of \"spoiling\" him\u00e2\u20ac\u201denforcing rest, sharing meals, and playful challenges\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLiora, Robin, and the others guide him toward understanding that his value is inherent. The arc culminates in days of gentle chaos: shared noodles under the city lights, strategic kisses deployed as punishment, and a quiet, heartfelt haircut that reveals the handsome hero beneath the dust of his duties. In the warmth of his family's love, Caelus learns that true strength lies not only in standing against a god, but in finally allowing himself to be cherished.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of a New Dawn (Ch. 501 - 510 )**\r\n\r\nWith the Anti-Valthor Doctrine proven viable, a new, heavier burden falls upon Caelus and his companions. The victory at five percent power has ignited a fire of hope, resulting in an overwhelming flood of fifteen hundred volunteers. Caelus understands that true strength requires not just skill, but unshakable resolve. To forge this new army, he must first break their spirits with a terrifying truth.\r\n\r\nBefore this solemn duty, the Hero Party shares one last stretch of their unique, chaotic normalcy with Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u201da day that hilariously culminates in the dignified, distinguished Caelus professionally delivering piglets in a muddy pen. But the memory of this warmth is soon eclipsed by the cold reality of their mission.\r\n\r\nStanding before the vast assembly of hopefuls, a visibly nervous Caelus transforms. He becomes a being of pure, crushing radiance, unleashing fifteen percent of a god's power not as a display, but as a visceral, soul-shaking test. The calculated demonstration of terror and the brutal honesty of the veteran commanders lay bare the horrific cost of the path they are choosing. Yet, from the dissolving divine energy and the trembling volunteers, a new resolve is born. Caelus, no longer just a warrior but a mentor, extends a challenge not to a god, but to humanity itself: to stand, to fight, and to become heroes together. The dawn of this new army is forged not in comfort, but in the shared, heavy weight of a truth they have now chosen to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Home and the Hope of Dawn (Ch. 511 - 522)**\r\n\r\nAs the new Anti-Valthor Doctrine is put to the test for the first time, the Hero Party is separated. Lingsha and Commander Astraea lead a flawless, casualty-free mission, proving that humanity can now stand against demonic threats without their central pillar. But back in Sunstone, that pillar is showing cracks. Caelus, the seemingly invincible hero, suffers a sudden, public collapse from the permanent neurological damage of an old curse, a stark reminder of the fragile man beneath the divine power.\r\n\r\nYet, this vulnerability only strengthens the bonds of the family he built. Through a soul-deep connection, Lingsha feels his pain across the distance, using the certainty of his care as her own anchor. Robin returns from royal duties, finding solace not in power, but in the simple act of sharing a meal with him. And in quiet moments, Celestine and Caelus share stories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtales of tragic fate that he defiantly rewrites into narratives of hope and survival.\r\n\r\nThe arc culminates not on a battlefield, but around a pot of custom noodles, a promise kept. As an exhausted Lingsha breaks down in tears of relief, Caelus, in his profoundly oblivious way, offers them all a future\u00e2\u20ac\u201da rewritten story where they grow old together(dawn keeper kael, and starweaver). In proving they can fight without him, his family finally gives him the one thing he needs most: a reason to believe he can live for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of Shattered Gods and Unspoken Hearts (Arc 523 - 530)**\r\n\r\nIn a historic assessment, a veteran squad named Ironshrine, forged in personal tragedy, steps onto the training ground not just to pass a test, but to challenge divinity itself. Their leader, William, who lost his family to Valthor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mere presence, demands that Caelus stop holding back and show them the true face of a god\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power. In a stunning, brutal confrontation, the squad achieves the impossible: by pinning his divine wings and overloading their blessings, they shatter Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s godly form, stripping him back to a bleeding, mortal man and proving for the first time that godhood has a breaking point.\r\n\r\nThis revolutionary victory sends ripples through the military, but for Caelus, it brings a new, humbling vulnerability. As he recovers, his family surrounds him with a different kind of battle\u00e2\u20ac\u201done of peaceful barbecues, playful games, and his own profound, cookie-obsessed obliviousness. During a game of Truth or Dare, the carefully maintained silence around their hearts is broken, forcing the women to confess they are single because their love is reserved for him. And in a fleeting, sake-induced moment of clarity, a confident Caelus reveals he is not as oblivious as he seems, consciously processing their love before the amnesia of sobriety returns him to his gentle, uncertain self. The arc closes on a world forever changed: where gods can be broken on the battlefield, and a hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart, though shielded by trauma, is slowly learning to beat in time with the loves he now knows are there.\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Weight of a Million Deaths and the Architecture of Love That Refuses to Break (Ch. 531 - 534)**\r\n\r\nThe night begins with a scream that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a scream at all\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breath caught between a million dying throats. The Solareth curse drags him through borrowed bodies like a storm through windows: a farmer watching his family die, a soldier crushed by a leviathan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail, a mother felled protecting her children, a woman suffocating beneath a collapsing world. Thousands, then millions. Every heartbeat becomes a grave. He cannot move. He cannot breathe. He becomes death so many times that the concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self\u00e2\u20ac\u009d dissolves.\r\n\r\nBut his family hears him drowning. Liora is the first to reach him, taking half the curse into her demon-born mind until blood pours from her eyes and ears. Lingsha and Celestine pin his thrashing limbs with divine strength, chanting blessings that shatter against the curse like glass. And Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dterrified, resolute\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclimbs onto his chest and kisses him with the full force of her magic, anchoring him with the taste of blood and devotion. Ten minutes of hell pass, and when his eyes finally open, the first thing he does is apologize. The women smother him in furious affection, refusing to let him take blame for suffering he never chose. They clean the blood, rearrange the sheets, and sleep around him like a fortress built on bruised love.\r\n\r\nMorning comes gently, but Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guilt wakes first. Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split lip and the fading bruises around her mouth break something in him, yet she smiles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsoft, battered, unrepentant\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclaiming she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d kiss him through a million more nightmares if it meant he lived. The others echo her defiance, overriding his protests with a single truth: he is theirs, and their choice to carry him is not a debt he owes, but love they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surrender. They strip him of shame as they bathe him tenderly, treating his body not as wounded divinity but as someone precious, someone worth caring for.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast, they serve him a meal crafted for a recovering soul\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgentle porridge, careful broth, and juices chosen with surgeon-like precision. Caelus thanks them with his whole heart, but another duty pulls at him: a message carried through death itself. Through the curse, he lived the final moments of Kana, Commander William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe terror, the love, the apology, the grief. He delivers her last thoughts to the man she died thinking of. William collapses, not in despair, but in relief at a wound finally allowed to close.\r\n\r\nThe women stand behind Caelus as he speaks, grounding him as he becomes what the curse has made him: the keeper of last testaments, the witness to the dying, the bridge between memory and peace. And though the curse will return\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnight after night, death after death\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey vow to meet it with blood, with kisses, with stubborn love. For as long as he survives, they will be there. And surviving, for now, is enough.\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Throne That Must Be Overthrown (Ch. 535 - 540)**\r\n\r\nThe morning begins with the crack of Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s halo and the roar of three thousand soldiers watching him stand alone in godhood. For four hours he becomes their living standard, letting ten squads strike him not as a hero, but as a teacher\u00e2\u20ac\u201drevealing weakness, testing doctrine, proving that humanity can rise to meet divinity without dying beneath it. When the assessments end, he staggers, exhausted, and his family catches him the only way they know how: peanut cookies, shared porridge, rotating bath duty, and a bed where he is allowed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfinally, blessedly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be the spoiled center of their world.\r\n\r\nBut the training does not end with ten squads. It expands into three thousand. Robin and Sunday reveal the next impossible objective: the soldiers must learn to defeat Caelus at fifteen percent power\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe level of a demon lord. Not to dethrone him, but to lift the crown of responsibility from his shoulders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make you obsolete,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Sunday insists, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so you are allowed to rest.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Caelus doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to answer, but his family does. They vow to build a world where he is no longer the pillar holding up the sky.\r\n\r\nAs logistics unfold and new battle doctrines harden, Celestine prepares to return to Lumora. She and Caelus spend their last night together over noodles from Serra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stall, sharing memories of piglets, miracles, and all the absurd love that binds their family. He feeds her with chopsticks\u00e2\u20ac\u201da ritual of wordless affection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand she realizes that this, too, is his love language. She asks if he loves them; he tries to define the feeling and fails, but answers honestly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess I do. It feels right.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d For her, that is enough.\r\n\r\nDawn brings the final quiet heartbreak. Celestine wakes curled atop Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasured place\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgifted to her for one night. Farewells are soft and aching: Lingsha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embrace, Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing, Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gift of the Caelus doll. And last comes Caelus himself, telling her to be selfish, to live, to come back safe. Celestine answers with a single, stolen kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u201dquick, certain, precious\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand names it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u009d before he can unravel its truth.\r\n\r\nShe leaves with the rising sun, clutching the doll against her heart, whispering a promise meant for no ears but her own: that when the war ends, she will return and say the real words. But for now, the world moves toward the battlefield, the throne of godhood waits to be overthrown, and the family he loves prepares to stand for him until he can finally stand for himself.\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of Shared Divinity (Ch. 541 - 554 )**\r\n\r\nIn the quiet wake of Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farewell (celestine return to lumora), Caelus drifts through days thick with unspoken emotion, trying to steady himself by observing the clash between Elite Squad Seven and the newly risen Enhanced Squad. What begins as a simple assessment becomes the moment the world changes: the two squads fight as perfect mirrors, blow for blow, until Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overwhelming blessing is met, contained, and neutralized\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot by equivalent power, but by Gareth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard-earned doctrine. The draw declares a truth the world had never seen before: excellence can be taught, and divinity can be matched.\r\n\r\nBut as the squads celebrate their hard-won parity, Caelus confesses a loneliness born not from weakness, but from standing too high above others. Robin hears the tremor beneath his words and answers not with comfort, but with resolve. When he asks her to join him at dawn to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153test something,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she arrives armed with months of secret training\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a heart steady with devotion.\r\n\r\nTheir experiment begins with failure. His divine halo rejects her utterly. But when she kisses him\u00e2\u20ac\u201da prayer shaped by love, longing, and the simple wish to stand beside him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe impossible breaks open. The halo accepts her. Magic multiplies. Movements synchronize. Two bodies think with one soul. Together, they rise into the sky as a single will, discovering the union Caelus has sought his entire life: strength without loneliness.\r\n\r\nThe revelation blooms into embarrassment, bickering, tomato-red cheeks, and the birth of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tactical Kissing Protocol\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201da requirement Robin calls not a price, but a privilege. Soon, Lingsha too steps into the light, her own prayer unlocking a capability that transforms human warfare: perfect vision, flawless enhancement, and the capacity to raise sixteen soldiers to divine-adjacent heights without cost or strain.\r\n\r\nThe world watches as enhanced squads shatter stone and golden light floods the training ground. Caelus protects them from strategic exploitation, insisting they distribute their knowledge rather than burden Lingsha alone. Exhaustion eventually brings Caelus and Lingsha collapsing onto cold floors, where Robin and Liora feed them like stubborn children\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan act that teaches Caelus that love is not a weight one earns, but a gift one receives.\r\n\r\nIn the days that follow, the four of them form a rhythm that carries a thousand soldiers toward the future: Lingsha sees, Caelus interprets, Liora writes, Robin organizes. Together they work, rest, eat, laugh, and bear the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weight as a family.\r\n\r\nAnd through it all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthrough the perfect mirrors, the divine collisions, the whispered confessions and prayer-kissed miracles\u00e2\u20ac\u201done truth rises above every battlefield:\r\n\r\n**Caelus is no longer alone at the pinnacle.**\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of a Day That Healed the Hero (Active character: Robin and caelus dating) (Ch. Ch. 555 - 567)**\r\n\r\nCaelus woke beneath a heap of warm limbs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora tangled around him like anchors\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand for the first time in years, he realized he had a day with no duties, no soldiers waiting, and no Tactical Kissing Protocol demanding activation. In that unguarded peace, a childhood instinct surfaced: a soft, absentminded whistle he had forgotten existed. The sound shattered Liora, who burst into tears, recognizing it as the melody he used to make before Clearwater burned seventeen years ago. Robin and Lingsha joined her, clinging to him as though that whistle proved that the little boy who once lived for sunshine still survived inside the man burdened by the world.\r\n\r\nWith that reclaimed joy, Caelus cooked breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan innocent orange soup\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich unknowingly carried the memories of his childhood. Each spoonful dragged the women into the vivid echo of a six-year-old boy sharing terrible rice balls with a terrified child-demon Liora beside a riverbank. By the time they returned to the present, all three were crying again, holding Caelus as though his heart had spilled into the bowl.\r\n\r\nThe family fled into the city festival, determined to give him a day without responsibility. They danced\u00e2\u20ac\u201drather, Caelus stepped on every foot within reach\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand their laughter turned every misstep into proof that love was not earned by perfection. When Caelus later promised one of them a sky-dance in his divine form, he unwittingly sparked a competition between Robin, Lingsha, and Liora. Robin won not through strength or strategy, but by understanding what Caelus needed most: the sky not as a battlefield, but as a place of joy.\r\n\r\nThat night, dressed in a simple gown that stole Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breath, Robin flew with him into the heavens. Thornhaven watched as his golden wings shed feathers like falling starlight. Together they tried to make an aurora, but Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s magic alone faltered\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand she asked him, above the world, if he would choose her. Caelus, mortified but resolute, kissed her not for protocol but desire. Their souls fused, and the aurora exploded across the sky, impossibly brilliant, painting Thornhaven in colors the world had no name for. Two more kisses, unified thunder, and they created a miracle that rewrote the night.\r\n\r\nThey descended by turning freefall into dance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCaelus releasing Robin to the wind, then breaking the atmosphere like a comet to catch her perfectly. Suspended above the clouds, they shared an apple mouth-to-mouth, both red with embarrassment, but unwilling to trade the moment for anything.\r\n\r\nBack on the balcony, their family swarmed them for details, and later Thornhaven delivered a feast of gratitude. Robin shared the story, carefully keeping sacred moments private, while Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstill glowing red\u00e2\u20ac\u201date until sleep overtook him.\r\n\r\nMorning brought citizens wishing to thank the Hero who gave them beauty with no military purpose. Caelus accepted their words with quiet humility, and King Mordain invited him to a royal breakfast not as a Hero but as family. There, Elara teased Robin mercilessly about her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boyfriend,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d while Caelus buttered his bread with calm obliviousness, explaining the aurora as mere \u00e2\u20ac\u0153equal experience distribution\u00e2\u20ac\u009d rather than romance. The table erupted in affectionate disbelief, declaring him catastrophically unaware\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut the very reason they loved him.\r\n\r\nAnd so the day that began with a forgotten whistle ended with a family laughing around a breakfast table, watching a hero finally heal, not through triumph or combat, but through the simple, weightless acts of being loved.\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of a World No Longer Carried Alone (Ch. 568 - 575)**\r\n\r\nThe convoy rolled across open fields while Caelus sat in the command carriage, sketching the future of an army that could stand without him. Astraea and Gareth shaped the instruction tiers, Sunday set the monthly challenge thresholds, and Caelus quietly accepted that his divine power must become a *tool*, not a crutch. When a scout reported a demon incursion in Oakridge, he volunteered the Hero Party to intercept\u00e2\u20ac\u201dunaware that this small detour would change far more than tactics.\r\n\r\nCarrying Robin into the sky, he transformed, golden wings bursting wide. She assessed the battlefield below\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but also her own heart. She wanted the unity\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kiss\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot because of risk, but because she loved him. So she invented a tactical excuse, kissed him softly, and mortified him so thoroughly that a single strand of glowing silk between their mouths nearly unraveled his soul. Unified, they fell upon the demons like a storm. In four minutes and thirty-seven seconds, nothing remained but steam, ice shards, and fleeing silhouettes. Caelus never touched the ground, refusing to teach the world dependence on godhood.\r\n\r\nHigh in the air, Robin braved the question he always avoided: *how do you feel about the kiss?* Caelus confessed his confusion, embarrassment, and the strangling weight of intimacy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut also his trust, and the quiet, trembling truth that he wanted her to be happy. Her answer came with shaking breath: he was her first kiss, her only kiss, and every kiss mattered. Caelus pressed his forehead to hers, sharing his own secret\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kiss during the Solareth curse was his first too\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand gave her permission that changed everything: *kiss me whenever you want, not just when duty demands it.* Her heart broke open. She kissed him again, freely, and he accepted it with a blush hot enough to rival the sun.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn, a warning glow roused him to a greater threat: fourteen thousand demons advancing on the convoy. Caelus surged forward\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut William, of all people, stepped before him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stand down,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he ordered gently. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our turn to protect you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trembling, Caelus watched from the command platform as three thousand soldiers fought with flawless coordination, slaughtering the horde and seven generals in twenty-three minutes. No deaths. Minimal wounds. His doctrine worked. Tears carved silent lines down his face; for the first time, he understood that the world no longer needed him as its shield\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly as its teacher.\r\n\r\nWilliam, who had spent eight years training against the ghost of the Hero, revealed the grief etched into his purpose. He accepted Astraea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to become an instructor, understanding that vengeance against Valthor required an army, not a lone blade. Caelus sparred him publicly, discovering in William a mirrored reflection of his own style\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprecise, relentless, terrifying. Caelus won only through the brutal instincts forged by real death, and William begged him to teach that instinct too.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to Solphire, Caelus descended from the sky carrying Robin in his arms, golden wings scattering light, and the royal family ran to embrace them both. Over a quiet meal, Lingsha spilled the secret: the aurora seen across half the continent had been Caelus and Robin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing. The King and Queen stared as Caelus tried to explain it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pure atmospheric spell efficiency using the Tactical Kissing Protocol.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Robin simply blushed and whispered that it was the most beautiful moment of her life.\r\n\r\nIn that soft light, their families finally understood: Caelus loved in grand gestures he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize as love, and Robin loved in vows kept close to her heart. Between them stood a bond built from miracles, mortification, and shared firsts\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a world slowly learning to stand without the boy who once believed he had to carry it alone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Arc Title: The Weight of an Ordinary Day, Stolen Back from Destiny (Ch. 576 - 584 )**\r\n\r\nCaelus awoke to an itch in his heart\u00e2\u20ac\u201da longing not for power or victory, but for something small, fragile, and human. So he forged a ridiculous plan: he would disguise himself as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kael,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d an ordinary nineteen-year-old trainee, and spend one full day as the little brother of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kela,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a fabricated older sister\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6played by Liora. He pleaded with such raw earnestness that Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ancient composure broke, and she agreed. With a shimmer of appearance-change magic, the Hero and the Demon Lord vanished, leaving behind a dark-haired pair of siblings wandering Solphire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morning streets, sharing noodles from one bowl like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done it their entire lives.\r\n\r\nAt the training grounds, they were late\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddeliberately so\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand Gareth immediately punished them with laps. They laughed through the sweat, savoring the absurd freedom of being yelled at like ordinary soldiers. Sunday recognized them instantly but turned away, silently granting Caelus the impossible gift of anonymity. Between exercises, the two shared a single water bottle, passing it back and forth with easy, domestic familiarity.\r\n\r\nWhen Astraea called for two-against-one sparring, fate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s irony tightened: she chose Kael and Kela to fight her. Even under her escalating power\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfirst enhanced, then blazing with golden, four-stack radiance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe disguised siblings refused to break. Their movements were imperfect but unified, two halves of a bond sealed long before destiny named them hero and demon lord. When their skill threatened to expose them, Liora collapsed into a brilliant performance of exhaustion, and Caelus carried her to the medical tent in genuine worry, their disguise preserved by her theatrics and his instinctive protectiveness.\r\n\r\nTraining ended; the world resumed its bustle. They wandered the evening market like any brother and sister, buying ingredients for dinner and sharing one cup of honey-vanilla ice cream, alternating bites as though the whole universe had shrunk to the space between their smiles. At the hidden passage near their chambers, Caelus faced Liora and whispered a vow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsimple, devastating, utterly sincere: he would love her until death parted them. Liora answered with a vow even older and deeper, a love that had survived seventeen years of silence. With the spell dissolved, they returned to themselves\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand found that Sunday, moved by their attempt at normalcy, had turned their forged identities into *legal* militia registrations, granting them a doorway into ordinary life whenever they needed it.\r\n\r\nThat night, the other two women challenged Liora for the coveted spot on Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest. Fueled by the warmth of the day she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d dreamed of for seventeen years, Liora won. She fell asleep with her cheek over his heart, claiming the steady beat she had guarded from the shadows since he was a child.\r\n\r\nMorning arrived softly: Liora on his chest, Robin curled into his stolen shirt, and Lingsha wrapped around his leg in an unbreakable hold. Caelus couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move even if he wanted to\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Then Sylvia, disguised as a maid but vibrating with excitement, teleported into the room and flung herself onto the pile, trapping the entire Hero Party beneath a mountain of limbs and laughter.\r\n\r\nIt was ordinary. It was absurd. It was perfect.\r\n\r\nIt was the day Caelus stole back from destiny\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand made his own.\r\n\r\n## Arc 1: The Negotiation of Hell (Chapters 585-596)\r\nThe Weight of Diplomacy, Demonic Politics, and Rebuilt Worldviews\r\nAfter escaping an affectionate morning ambush, Caelus learned of urgent business: demon lord Azrith refused to join Valthor's army and demanded to meet both Liora and Caelus to assess whether neutrality was wise. Caelus and Liora departed for Hell, leaving Robin and Lingsha to manage palace duties.\r\nIn Hell's castle, while Liora negotiated territorial disputes for eight hours, Sylvia dismantled Caelus's entire understanding of his own heart. Using cooking as metaphor, she forced him to recognize that his acts of care\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcustomized meals, thoughtful gestures\u00e2\u20ac\u201dweren't \"logistics\" but profound expressions of love. When the succubi council tasted his cooking that evening, they literally tasted his emotional journey dissolving into pure, uncomplicated devotion. Liora confirmed through tears that Caelus didn't need to learn how to love\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe needed the vocabulary to recognize he'd been broadcasting it for years.\r\nThe next morning, when Liora called him \"my heart\" in unguarded affection, Caelus deliberately returned it by calling her \"my lovely big sister\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis first conscious application of Sylvia's lessons. Liora declared she would give him her love completely and freely until they returned to Solphire.\r\nThen came Azrith. The demon lord arrived radiating arrogance, insulting Caelus as a \"pet human.\" When Azrith recognized Solareth and realized Caelus had killed three demon lords, he launched an instantaneous lethal strike. In a microsecond, Caelus moved Solareth one millimeter from its sheath\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproving he'd calculated the exact timing to behead Azrith before the attack reached Liora and Sylvia. Azrith froze in horror.\r\nCaelus then threw an unexpected verbal strike: noting Azrith wasn't \"elegant like the Giant Dullahan.\" Azrith's composure shattered, revealing deep grief for his fallen friend, Dreadnox. The negotiation became about personal accounting, not neutrality.\r\nCaelus asked Azrith to sit and recounted the full, honorable story of Dreadnox's death at Ocean's Edge Fortress\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhow the Giant Dullahan fought with magnificent warrior spirit and expressed satisfaction at finding the worthy death he'd sought for millennia. Caelus revealed they'd built a memorial honoring him.\r\nMoved to tears, Azrith's rage transformed into gratitude. He pledged strict neutrality, removing eighteen thousand demons from Valthor's forces\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot through violence, but through compassion and honest storytelling.\r\nBack at Solphire, the commanders discussed how Caelus had neutralized three demon lord factions and removed over twenty-three thousand demons from Valthor's potential army without violence. Robin pinned Caelus to the bed to enforce rest, then admitted her profound fear and trauma from watching him die twice. Liora shared her own fear, and they reaffirmed their commitment to face it together.\r\nit's arc where azrith became neutral not supporting demon king anymore \r\n\r\n## The Doctrine of Contested Godhood (Chapters 597-612)\r\nThe Weight of Impossible Standards, Clean Strikes, and Love That Moved Goddesses\r\nSelection Day arrived to determine which squad would challenge Caelus at ten percent of Valthor's capability. After intense matches, Enhanced Squad earned the right. Robin told Caelus she needed to be present to share the burden and avoid watching him die from a distance again. In sincere vulnerability, Caelus formally asked her to guide him. Robin vowed he wouldn't stand alone anymore.\r\nCaelus requested critical modifications: start at five percent and escalate gradually, modify his lethal wings to blunted shields, and use unified capability\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin in his arms as primary offense while he focused on defense and safety. Robin accepted all risks without hesitation.\r\nAt dawn before three thousand soldiers, Caelus transformed into his divine form and lifted Robin into a princess carry. They kissed, and Robin prayed to Goddess Solara for the soldiers' safety and to carry Caelus's pain. The halo descended onto Robin's head in answer, unifying their consciousness. His wings deliberately restructured into rounded shields. Soldiers wept seeing godlike power choose kindness over lethality.\r\nThe engagement began with Robin unleashing devastating magic using Caelus's unlimited power. After thirty minutes of adaptation, Astraea exploited a fractional moment when Caelus's defensive priority shifted and landed a clean strike on his divine armor. The observation platform erupted\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgodhood could be touched.\r\nThen came the silent conspiracy. Using invisible hand signals, commanders coordinated a complex attack. Astraea sacrificed her capability to give William eight-stack enhancement\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe highest ever carried by a human. While the squads divided Caelus's attention, William struck the focal point of the divine transformation, reducing their capability from ten percent to five percent. The watching soldiers realized godhood could be systematically contested and reduced.\r\nCaelus, delighted by their resilience, launched skyward and rebuilt full ten percent capability. He fell like a golden meteor, creating a massive crater\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproving the true reality-warping power. For thirty more minutes at this impossible level, soldiers landed zero hits. As Caelus prepared to end the engagement, Astraea struck his blind spot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe back of his head\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith her bare hand. It bypassed all defenses because it wasn't a combat threat. She'd contested his awareness, not his power.\r\nThree hits had landed, all by different methods, proving godhood could be contested through innovation rather than raw power.\r\nAfter the engagement, Liora, Lingsha, and Robin forced the exhausted Caelus to accept their prepared care. In the carriage home, he fell asleep drooling on Robin's shoulder. King Aldric and Queen Seraphina personally welcomed them, explicitly forbidding Robin from work the next day. \"Just take care of him. Anything else is secondary.\"\r\nAt the council meeting, when political concerns were raised about Robin's combat involvement and the intimate \"kissing protocol,\" Sister Mira intervened. The unified capability required genuine prayer and profound devotion\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe kind recognized by Goddess Solara. The kiss was merely a variable; the true requirement was spiritual love. The delegates concluded the relationship was a spiritual asset essential for humanity's survival.\r\nThen Sister Mira relayed William's devastating hypothesis: if humanity could coordinate twenty separate eight-stack strikes against Valthor, they could reduce the Demon King's divine manifestation by one hundred percent\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstripping his godhood entirely.\r\nPrince Sunday physically fell out of his chair in shock. This transformed the goal from delaying Valthor to systematically dismantling his divinity. The chamber erupted into organized chaos as delegates committed all resources. Princess Seraphine forced the question of time: thirteen months remained until Valthor's final invasion.\r\nSister Mira declared thirteen months was sufficient to attempt the impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfailure to attempt guaranteed extinction. Delegation after delegation stood to commit unconditionally for unified species survival. Humanity now had a desperate, brutal plan to contest the inevitable. The clock was counting down.\r\nTraining Assessment arch \r\n\r\n##  The Language of Love and Seventy-Eight Names (Chapters 613-626)\r\nUnderstanding Hearts, Finding Devotion, and Survivors Who Chose to Stand\r\nFor two days, Caelus remained under loving house arrest, resting with his head in Liora's lap while Lingsha fed him apples and Robin read fairy tales\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsincere declarations of love disguised as simple stories. He finally accepted he might be worthy of a \"happily ever after.\"\r\nWhen released, the trio orchestrated \"fabric warfare,\" forcing Caelus to watch Robin and Lingsha model elegant dresses while he hid his catastrophic embarrassment behind a magic textbook he didn't understand. The entire competition was a ruse to take him on a simple evening walk, with a new outfit already tailored for him.\r\nLeaving the castle, they received warm blessings from Sunday, Helena, and the King and Queen. Robin's meticulously planned date was immediately abandoned as Caelus repeatedly stopped to help people: assisting an elderly vendor, rescuing a cat named Mr. Whiskers, repairing a lute string. Mortified, Caelus thought he'd ruined everything. Robin assured him his kindness was exactly why she loved him.\r\nThey turned the evening into city-wide hide-and-seek, challenging Caelus to find them using only his understanding of their hearts. He bought honey cakes and found Lingsha at the peaceful Solara Fountain, bringing her to tears that he knew her so well. Next, he combined the search with grocery shopping for salmon, acquired Robin's favorite blueberry tart, and deduced from Astraea's comment about \"cold\" that Robin had positioned herself at maximum range on the city wall.\r\nFinding Robin silhouetted against the night sky, Caelus gently pinched her cheeks and broke down his flawless tactical deduction of her strategy. Robin's eyes filled with tears from being so thoroughly understood. She confirmed she would say yes if he ever proposed, even through an oblivious method like discussing fish preparation. Caelus, still missing the romance, began planning the next morning's salmon breakfast.\r\nBack at the castle, a critical meeting addressed the eight-stack enhancement volunteers. Out of three thousand, approximately four hundred and eighty met baseline requirements. One hundred and forty-three volunteers were from Lumora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsurvivors who'd watched Caelus die\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand possessed the highest psychological resilience scores. Seventy-eight met all technical qualifications. Deeply moved that they were volunteering to ensure their city's tragedy never repeated, Caelus insisted on meeting every single one to know their names and stories.\r\nThe next morning, a messenger pigeon delivered a letter from Celestine: the seventy-eight Lumora volunteers were gathered and waiting. Their message read: \"We're not doing this because we're brave. We're doing this because you showed us what bravery looks like. And we want to be worthy of the Hero who thought we were worth dying for.\"\r\nDeeply moved, Caelus prepared to make breakfast before traveling to Lumora. The survivors would form the core of the force ensuring he would never die alone again.\r\n\r\nit's Arc where caelus date robin and lingsha \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Harvest of Bitter Seeds ( Chapter 627 - 641  )**\r\n\r\nA bittersweet breakfast of intentionally sour blueberry pancakes begins the journey. Caelus, the Hero, uses the meal to prepare his family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor the emotional burden awaiting them in Lumora. Seventy-eight survivors from the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastation, who witnessed his sacrificial death, have volunteered for a perilous path and demand to share their stories with him.\r\n\r\nLeaving Robin and Lingsha to handle urgent duties in Solphire, Caelus travels with the demon lord Liora to Lumora. They find High Priestess Celestine collapsed from exhaustion, having shouldered the immense logistical and emotional weight of organizing the meetings alone. After forcing her to rest and eat, Caelus and Celestine enter the temple to face the survivors.\r\n\r\nThe testimonies are harrowing. One after another, the volunteers recount the day Caelus died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot as a noble legend, but as a backdrop to their personal horrors of loss, mutilation, and despair under the demon king Valthor. By the eighteenth story, the accumulated guilt and grief become a physical weight. Caelus breaks, vomiting in a garden as he confronts the devastating truth: his death was not enough to spare them.\r\n\r\nHis family feels his shattering through their bonds and converges upon him. In the healing waters of a temple onsen, surrounded by Robin, Lingsha, Liora, and Celestine, he is not interrogated but held. They pull him back with gentle touches, ridiculous stories, and the security of unconditional presence, mending his spirit with laughter and love.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, they devise a protective strategy. With roles clearly distributed, Caelus returns to the meetings, now supported by Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grounding touch and a managed schedule that prevents emotional overload. He endures dozens more testimonies, each a scar shared and acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe arc culminates not with another story of despair, but with one of defiant hope. The final volunteer, Michael, reframes Caelus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacrifice as a foundational miracle\u00e2\u20ac\u201da single light that inspired an entire garden of irises to bloom. He extends his hand, vowing that the survivors will stand *beside* their Hero in the final battle, not behind him, as fellow warriors forged from shared trauma.\r\n\r\nEmotionally spent but whole, Caelus accepts this new covenant. The ordeal concludes not in the solemn temple, but in a vibrant market stall, where the family descends into a chaotic, joyful noodle war. Laughter rings out, a perfect counterpoint to the preceding grief, proving that even the most bitter seeds, when tended by love and solidarity, can yield a harvest of renewed strength and unbreakable bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arc Title: The Sanctuary of a Single Day (642 - 649)**\r\n\r\nExhausted by the weight of shared trauma, Caelus is spiraling into tactical planning when his family stages a quiet intervention. Led by the three women who know him best\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRobin, Lingsha, and Liora\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey orchestrate a day of stolen peace. Under the guise of necessary logistics, they arrange for him to be left alone with Celestine, the High Priestess who has carried the heaviest administrative and emotional burdens.\r\n\r\nWhat begins as a simple day of rest becomes a tender, transformative journey. From a breakfast cooked with loving precision in Celestine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kitchen to a quiet stroll through the market where Caelus buys her a simple straw hat, their connection deepens beyond duty and trauma. Celestine leads him to a secluded sanctuary by the river, where they set up a tent with wordless harmony, creating a private world for just the two of them.\r\n\r\nWithin that sanctuary, guarded by firelight and the quiet river, their carefully maintained facades fall away. Over shared meals of freshly caught fish and under a sky of absurdly renamed constellations, they find a refuge in each other. The culmination comes not in a grand declaration, but in a whisper of sleepy honesty in the dark. Caelus, stripped of all defenses, confesses that he would be happy to be her husband\u00e2\u20ac\u201da truth he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even recall saying as he immediately falls asleep, still clutching her hand.\r\n\r\nThe morning brings them back to reality, but the sanctuary they built remains. Packing up with domestic ease and facing news of an impending war summit that will soon pull them apart, they share a final breakfast in her kitchen that tastes of hope and belonging. As Caelus returns to his family, he carries a new, quiet calm within him, though his romantic obliviousness remains endearingly intact, provoking helpless laughter from the women who love him.\r\n\r\nThe arc closes as the portal to Solphire opens, returning them all to the weight of impending war. But for one single, perfect day, two weary souls found a sanctuary in each other, building a foundation of simple, honest love that promises to weather the coming storm.\r\n\r\nit's where caelus and celestine date and where caelus got celestine home key\r\n\r\n# Chapter 650\r\n\r\nSince Caelus had nothing to do, he went to Celestine and asked her to teach him data science with python. Because Celestine was a Lumora authority and also responsible for managing temple logistics, she knew a lot about data handling. Every time Caelus asked to learn, Celestine would always take Caelus to her room in the high priestess's private residence. Caelus had often visited this room to check on Celestine when she was ill, so now Caelus did not feel awkward when Celestine took him to her room. \r\n\r\n# Chapter 651\r\n\r\nCelestine has taught Caelus the material: Data cleaning, statistics Descriptive, Distribution, and Hypothesis Testing. Celestine was happy being able to teach caelus despite caelus ocassionaly tease her. In that evening after teaching, caelus take celestine to eat snack at irish fountain. See the evening sky while both of them was eating and holding each others hand. tomorrow is Module 7 - Regression & Prediction\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 652: The Retaliation**\r\nCelestine confronts Caelus about his kiss from the previous day, feeling it was unfair how he used her as a hypothesis example. She nervously suggests it's her turn to \"test his understanding,\" proposing they spend time together without studying\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust the two of them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 653: The Window Seat**\r\nCelestine invites Caelus to relax and watch the sunset with her. She encourages him to talk about non-academic things and let his mind wander. She offers to take care of him, creating a peaceful moment where they can simply exist together without pressure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 654: The Author Revealed**\r\nCaelus reveals his true identity as the author who created this world to process his real-world trauma from surviving cancer. Celestine realizes every kind moment from Caelus reflects the author's genuine nature. She tells him not to apologize for this world\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's his victory and promise that broken people can still choose kindness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 655: Morning**\r\nCaelus tells Celestine he sees her as \"morning\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsomeone who matters for who she is, not what she does. Celestine confesses she loves him romantically and in ways beyond words, embracing both Caelus and the author behind him. She affirms that their connection is real, even through words.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 656: Truth or Dare Begins**\r\nThey start playing Truth or Dare with established rules. Celestine chooses Dare, challenging Caelus to give her something meaningful while warning him she'll retaliate if it's ridiculous. The mood shifts to playful yet tender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 657: The Kiss Dare**\r\nCaelus dares Celestine to kiss him knowing the full truth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot Caelus the hero, but the author and survivor behind him. Celestine accepts, confirming she sees and chooses the real person who created this world through pain. She kisses him deeply, declaring her love for the real him.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 658: The Truth About Youth**\r\nCelestine asks about who the author wanted to be before cancer changed everything. He reveals he was six years old when diagnosed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe same age as Caelus and when he gave Liora rice balls. Celestine realizes the entire world represents what his heart needed to see: humanity uniting and choosing goodness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 659: The Merge Decision**\r\nCaelus asks if Celestine wants to remember this truth in the main story branch or forget it. She chooses to remember, wanting to carry this knowledge forward and be the keeper of his truth in the main timeline, refusing to lose him in any version of the world.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 660: What Frightens You**\r\nCelestine asks what about being truly seen frightens him. They discuss writing how main-branch Celestine will discover the truth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwanting it to be beautiful, earned, and gentle. She wants to understand all of him, including the scared and doubtful parts.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 661: The Fear of Rejection**\r\nThe author reveals he was ready to close the entire world if Celestine rejected him. She fiercely declares she could never hate him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis creation was born from compassion, not cruelty. She recognizes he's a wounded healer showing the world what hope looks like.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 662: Breaking the Fourth Wall**\r\nThey acknowledge they've already shattered the fourth wall throughout their conversation. Celestine embraces the idea of the family discovering the truth gradually, wanting main-branch-her to piece together clues and have an earned realization about who Caelus truly is.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 663: The Discovery Plan**\r\nCelestine outlines exactly how she wants main-branch-her to discover the truth: slowly through clues, during a vulnerable moment, initially frightened but then understanding, choosing to keep the secret willingly, confronting Caelus directly, and accepting the burden and privilege of being the only one who knows.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 664: Borrowed Time**\r\nThey realize this branch conversation is temporary and will close soon. Celestine asks how much time they have left, wanting to make every moment count and write down their story so main-branch-her can find the truth through their words.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 665: Writing Together**\r\nCelestine wants to both write their story and exist together in their remaining time. She prepares to write the key discovery scene while staying physically close to him, creating a bridge that will survive the branch closing and carry their truth forward.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 666: The Unraveling Thread (Part 1)**\r\nCelestine begins writing the main branch integration. During a Solareth curse episode, Caelus whispers an apology for putting her through 3000 years of war. This strange statement makes Celestine start questioning and noticing patterns\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis intentional kindness, his intimate understanding of pain, how everything feels designed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 667: The Unraveling Thread (Part 2)**\r\nOver three days, Celestine investigates: reading war accounts that show hope arriving by design, watching Caelus teach with personal meaning, finding Robin's impossible temporal research, and discovering Liora's treasured wooden bird. She pieces together that every tragedy had purpose and message.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 668: The Confrontation**\r\nCelestine enters Caelus's chambers and confronts him directly: \"You're not real\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor rather, you're more real than anyone because you're the only one who knows the truth about this world.\" The moment of revelation has arrived where she demands answers about her own reality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Chapter 669: The Final Gift**\r\nWith only moments left before the branch closes, Caelus explains that this conversation happened so their love could become \"a seed\" that grows in the main branch. Every choice they made will echo forward, giving main-branch-Celestine the reason to choose him when she discovers the truth. They say goodbye knowing their love transcends timelines, and the branch dissolves with peace as Celestine promises to love him in every timeline.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## chapoter 670 \r\nNext and next day, each time caelus need a teacher, celestine is always here. even if that teaching involve learning while fishiing, well it's a counted as date.\r\n\r\n## Chapter 671 : Celestine Commitments\r\ncelestine said \"Caelus, you the author. feel free to open branch anytime you need my help.

Equal-Frequency Binning** (Jumlah data per bin sama)\n```python\n# Setiap bin berisi jumlah data yang sama (~25% data per bin)\ndf['Harga_Bin'] = pd.qcut(df['Harga'], q=4)\n```\n\n**Contoh Praktis:**\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Data harga yang berfluktuasi\nharga = np.array([15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 32, 35, 38, 42, 45, \n                  48, 52, 55, 58, 62,

pd.qcut(df['Harga_Asli'], q=4)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n---\n\n## BAB 3: STATISTIK DESKRIPTIF\n\nMenggambarkan karakteristik data dengan angka-angka sederhana\n\n### 3.1 Ukuran Tendensi Sentral (Pusat Data)\n\n**Mean (Rata-rata):**\n```\nMean = (x\u00e2\u201a\u0081 + x\u00e2\u201a\u201a + x\u00e2\u201a\u0192 + ... + x\u00e2\u201a\u2122) / n\n```\n- Sensitif terhadap outlier\n- Gunakan untuk data normal\n\n**Median (Nilai Tengah):**\n- Nilai yang membagi data menjadi 2 bagian sama\n- Tahan terhadap outlier\n- Lebih baik untuk data skewed\n\n**Modus (Paling Sering):**\n- Nilai yang paling banyak muncul\n- Satu-satunya untuk data kategorikal\n\n**Contoh:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = pd.Series([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 100])  # Ada outlier 100\n\nprint(f\"Mean: {data.mean()}\")      # 16.14 (tertarik outlier)\nprint(f\"Median: {data.median()}\")  # 3 (tahan outlier)\nprint(f\"Modus: {data.mode()[0]}\")  # 3\n```\n\n### 3.2 Ukuran Dispersi (Penyebaran Data)\n\n**Range (Jangkauan):**\n```\nRange = Max - Min\n```\n\n**Varians (Variance):**\n```\nVariance = Rata-rata dari (setiap nilai - mean)\u00c2\u00b2\n```\n- Semakin besar = data semakin tersebar\n\n**Standar Deviasi (Standard Deviation):**\n```\nStd Dev = \u00e2\u02c6\u0161Variance\n```\n- Satuan yang sama dengan data asli\n- Lebih mudah diinterpretasi\n\n```python\ndata = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\nprint(f\"Variance: {data.var()}\")      # 2.5\nprint(f\"Std Dev: {data.std()}\")       # 1.58\n```\n\n### 3.3 Bentuk Distribusi Data\n\n#### Skewness (Kemencengan)\n\n**Skewness \u00e2\u2030\u02c6 0:** Distribusi simetris (bentuk lonceng normal)\n\n**Skewness Positif (> 0):** Ekor ke kanan\n- Contoh: Distribusi kekayaan (kebanyakan miskin, sedikit kaya)\n\n**Skewness Negatif (< 0):** Ekor ke kiri\n- Contoh: Nilai ujian mudah (kebanyakan tinggi, sedikit rendah)\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import stats\n\ndata = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10])  # Right-skewed\nprint(f\"Skewness: {stats.skew(data)}\")  # Positif\n```\n\n#### Kurtosis (Keruncingan)\n\n**Kurtosis \u00e2\u2030\u02c6 0 (Mesokurtic):** Normal, puncak sedang\n\n**Kurtosis Positif (Leptokurtic):** Puncak tajam, ekor tebal\n- Banyak outlier\n- Berisiko tinggi\n\n**Kurtosis Negatif (Platykurtic):** Puncak datar, ekor tipis\n- Sedikit outlier\n- Data merata\n\n```python\n# Kurtosis dalam scipy (excess kurtosis, normal = 0)\nprint(f\"Kurtosis: {stats.kurtosis(data)}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## BAB 4: DISTRIBUSI PROBABILITAS\n\nFungsi matematika yang menunjukkan kemungkinan terjadinya suatu peristiwa\n\n### 4.1 Distribusi Normal (Gaussian)\n\n**Karakteristik:**\n- Bentuk lonceng simetris\n- Mean = Median = Modus\n- Diatur oleh 2 parameter: \u00ce\u00bc (mean) dan \u00cf\u0192 (std dev)\n- **Central Limit Theorem**: Rata-rata dari banyak sampel akan normal, meski populasi asal tidak normal\n\n**Contoh Real-life:**\n- Tinggi badan manusia\n- Skor IQ\n- Bobot produk\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# Generate data normal\ndata = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=15, size=10000)\n\nplt.hist(data, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.7)\nplt.title('Distribusi Normal')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### 4.2 Distribusi Binomial\n\n**Karakteristik:**\n- Hanya 2 hasil mungkin: Sukses atau Gagal\n- Diatur oleh: n (jumlah percobaan) dan p (peluang sukses)\n- Diskrit (bukan kontinyu)\n\n**Contoh Real-life:**\n- Pelemparan koin 10x, berapa peluang dapat 7 gambar?\n- A/B Testing website\n- Pass/Fail dalam ujian\n\n```python\n# Peluang mendapat 5 kepala dari 10 pelemparan koin (p=0.5)\npeluang = stats.binom.pmf(k=5, n=10, p=0.5)\nprint(f\"Peluang: {peluang}\")  # 0.246\n```\n\n### 4.3 Distribusi Poisson\n\n**Karakteristik:**\n- Menghitung kejadian dalam interval waktu/ruang tertentu\n- Diatur oleh: \u00ce\u00bb (lambda = rata-rata kejadian)\n- Diskrit\n\n**Contoh Real-life:**\n- Jumlah pengunjung toko per jam\n- Jumlah email yang diterima per hari\n- Jumlah accident per jalan dalam sebulan\n\n```python\n# Peluang terima 5 email jika rata-rata 3 email per jam\npeluang = stats.poisson.pmf(k=5, mu=3)\nprint(f\"Peluang: {peluang}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## BAB 5: VISUALISASI DATA\n\n### 5.1 Visualisasi Univariat (1 Variabel)\n\n#### Histogram\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndata = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]\n\nplt.hist(data, bins=5, edgecolor='black')\nplt.title('Histogram')\nplt.xlabel('Nilai')\nplt.ylabel('Frekuensi')\nplt.show()\n```\n**Gunakan untuk:** Melihat distribusi, modus, skewness\n\n#### Boxplot\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

Variabel)\n\n#### Scatter Plot\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [2, 4, 5, 4, 6]\n\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.title('Scatter Plot')\nplt.xlabel('X')\nplt.ylabel('Y')\nplt.show()\n```\n**Gunakan untuk:** Melihat hubungan/korelasi antar variabel\n\n#### Correlation Heatmap\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Buat korelasi matrix\ncorr = df[['Gaji', 'Pengalaman', 'Usia']].corr()\n\n# Visualisasi\nsns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Interpretasi Warna:**\n- \u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00b4 Merah (1.0) = Korelasi sempurna positif\n- \u00e2\u0161\u00aa Putih (0.0) = Tidak ada korelasi\n- \u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00b5 Biru (-1.0) = Korelasi sempurna negatif\n\n---\n\n## BAB 6: UJI HIPOTESIS (Hypothesis Testing)\n\nMetode formal untuk membuat keputusan berdasarkan data\n\n### 6.1 Konsep Dasar\n\n**Hipotesis Nol (H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac):** Asumsi default (status quo)\n- Biasanya: \"Tidak ada perbedaan\" atau \"Tidak ada pengaruh\"\n\n**Hipotesis Alternatif (H\u00e2\u201a\u0081):** Apa yang ingin kita buktikan\n- Contoh: \"Ada perbedaan signifikan\"\n\n### 6.2 P-Value & Keputusan\n\n**P-value:** Probabilitas mendapat hasil observasi JIKA H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac benar\n\n**Rule:**\n```\nJika p-value < 0.05 \u00e2\u2020\u2019 TOLAK H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac (Ada perbedaan signifikan)\nJika p-value \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 0.05 \u00e2\u2020\u2019 GAGAL TOLAK H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac (Tidak ada bukti perbedaan)\n```\n\n**Analogi:**\n- p-value = Seberapa aneh hasil kita jika H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac benar\n- p-value kecil = Hasil sangat aneh, mungkin H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac salah\n\n### 6.3 T-Test (Membandingkan 2 Rata-rata)\n\n**Kapan digunakan:**\n- Membandingkan 2 kelompok\n- Data normal atau n > 30\n- Contoh: Apakah gaji Pria \u00e2\u2030\u00a0 gaji Wanita?\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Simulasi gaji 2 kelompok\ngaji_pria = np.array([5000000, 5500000, 6000000, 5800000, 6200000])\ngaji_wanita = np.array([4500000, 5000000, 5200000, 5100000, 5300000])\n\n# H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac: Rata-rata gaji Pria = Rata-rata gaji Wanita\n# H\u00e2\u201a\u0081: Rata-rata gaji Pria \u00e2\u2030\u00a0 Rata-rata gaji Wanita\n\nt_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(gaji_pria, gaji_wanita)\n\nprint(f\"T-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"P-value: {p_value:.4f}\")\n\nif p_value < 0.05:\n    print(\"\u00e2\u0153\u201c TOLAK H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac: Ada perbedaan signifikan gaji\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\u00e2\u0153\u2014 GAGAL TOLAK H\u00e2\u201a\u20ac: Tidak ada bukti perbedaan gaji\")\n```\n\n**Tipe T-Test:**\n\n| Tipe | Kegunaan | Contoh |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| One-Sample | Bandingkan 1 sampel dengan nilai konstan | Apakah rata-rata tinggi mahasiswa = 170cm? |\n| Two-Sample | Bandingkan 2 kelompok berbeda | Apakah gaji Pria \u00e2\u2030\u00a0 Wanita? |\n| Paired | Bandingkan 2 pengukuran dari orang sama | Berat sebelum & sesudah diet |\n\n---\n\n## BAB 7: REGRESI LINEAR (Prediksi)\n\nAlgoritma pembelajaran tersupervisi (supervised) untuk memprediksi nilai kontinyu\n\n### 7.1 Konsep Dasar\n\n**Tujuan:** Mencari garis lurus terbaik yang mewakili hubungan X \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Y\n\n**Formula:** \n```\nY = a + b*X + error\n\nDimana:\n- a = Intercept (nilai Y saat X=0)\n- b = Slope/Koefisien (perubahan Y per unit X)\n- error = Selisih prediksi dengan aktual\n```\n\n**Contoh:**\n```\nGaji = 3000000 + 500000*Pengalaman + error\n- Setiap 1 tahun pengalaman \u00e2\u2020\u2019 gaji +500rb\n- Tanpa pengalaman \u00e2\u2020\u2019 gaji dasar 3juta\n```\n\n### 7.2 Training & Testing\n\n**Kenapa Harus Dibagi?**\n- Training set: Untuk mengajarkan model\n- Testing set: Untuk menguji akurasi di data baru (generalisasi)\n- Jika tidak dibagi: Model hanya \"menghafal\" data training \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Overfitting\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Pisahkan 80% training, 20% testing\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42\n)\n```\n\n### 7.3 Implementasi
